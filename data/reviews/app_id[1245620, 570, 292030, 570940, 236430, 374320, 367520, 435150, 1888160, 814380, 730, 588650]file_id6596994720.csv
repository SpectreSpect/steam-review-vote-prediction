,148833183,"Moving on to a new higher difficulty always feels incredible. Even there there is a lot of RNG in it, it never feels unfair since even the least optimal weapons and items are actually more than serviceable thanks to movement being king at all times.

,134311622,"I know my playtime doesn't look like much, but I have played this game on Xbox and on Mobile for collectively over 700 hours and have now purchased it for PC as well. I can't say this game's praise loud enough. This game has everything I need in a roguelike. Very challenging, incredibly satisfying and fast-paced combat that goes hand-in-hand with the game's solid platformer elements, gorgeous backdrops, a great soundtrack with some real bangers, crisp sound design (that dinging crit noise is a massive dopamine injection), as well as tons of secrets, easter eggs and references to other classic franchises that can easily take you over 200 hours of gameplay just to see them all. The game has a simple yet very rewarding affix system which allows you to create new synergies every run, is run by passionate developers that keep on dishing out fantastic content (the DLCs especially!), has an intriguing world and story, a very high skill ceiling and a custom mode if you just want to play with your favourite weapons or tweak your run in some creative ways as well as an accessibility mode for players who want a casual experience without much stress. In addition to all that, there is a huge amount of unlocks in the game that require you play on higher and higher difficulties just to get them all. Every single one of the unlockable weapons all play differently, and unlockable mutations give you additional upgrades you can equip in between stages. Even after unlocking every weapon, item and outfit in the base game, there's fun daily runs (which also grant you weapon unlocks), boss rush (with even more unlocks, arguably the most challenging to get in the game), and so-called ""aspects"" that alter the game significantly by giving you some really overpowered and fun abilites to play around with. Easiest 10/10 of my life.

",True
,143102963,"Somehow I haven't written a review for this game yet... but I think it's safe to say Dead Cells is my game of the year for 2023. (Okay so that isn't true anymore, but Dead Cells is my 2nd best game of the year. Sea of Stars beat it lol. Sorry.)

Technically, I began playing it in 2022.. but it was for under 2 hours and then I stopped. As the new Castlevania DLC was coming out in March 2023, I was thinking then would be a good chance to pick the game back up and give it a better chance. After all, I didn't hate the game. I just stopped playing it for some reason (a strange trend I do when I start a game then proceed not to play it for an extended period of time)...

Regardless, about the game. Every part about it is absolutely delightful. The gameplay? Fun and challenging. Winning battles feels rewarding and even when you lose, you're still learning. The weapons? Fun to use. I was a brutality enjoyer when I first started, then I slowly started sinking into the survival class. I've never been a fan of tactics unfortunately... But the game is pretty balanced for the most part. You can also turn on some features to make the game a little bit more attuned to your tastes, to help you ease into the harder difficulties. When I started 5BC, I had been using the cursed chest aspect, but slowly overtime I began to stop using it (I wanted to be able to get gold costumes lol).

The amount of items that there are in this game comes nowhere close to what a game like The Binding of Isaac has (literal thousands of hours), but it also doesn't have a shortage of items. I'm 139 hours through playing and I still haven't found all the items (where's the ukulele!?). I know I could just use the item made to get blueprints guaranteed, but it doesn't feel as nice then. But it's always there if you ever want to get all the items.

The diversity in areas? Amazing! Of course if you don't own the DLC's, you'll only be going through the same one or two paths over and over. But with the DLC's, it offers you so many different paths to take and of course, all the other stuff DLC's have to offer. If you haven't picked up Dead Cells, I would suggest getting the DLC's with it. It makes the game so much bigger in so many different aspects.

And the music.. OH, the music. It wasn't as great as something like The Messenger, Hades, or Omori in something I would listen to again, but the music absolutely does not disappoint. And the Castlevania OST as well? Even more fantastic! I actually prefer using that one. The music on Fractured Shrines with the Castlevania OST on is my favorite track. Next to the music in the spoiler biome as well.

I'm pretty sure there's a LOAD of categories I'm missing about this game, but that just shows how much there really is to it. Just.. get Dead Cells. You won't be disappointed. I surely wasn't.",True

,148314989,"It really is one of the best roguelike-Metroidvania games I've ever played. The excellent musical score, amazingly responsive controls, huge variety of weapons, challenging bosses - the developers have really just put everything together in an amazingly tight package.

Props on the longevity of support, too - the game came out 2018, and there's a new free content patch that just entered beta testing this week.

Dead Cells has over 100 weapons, each fitting into at least one of the following categories: Brutality / Tactics / Survival. Brutality weapons tend to be fast, but hit for smaller amounts (swords and daggers, mostly), Tactics are almost all ranged weapons (bows, crossbows, and whips, mostly), while survival weapons are almost all hard-hitting, very slow weapons (mauls, hammers, etc.) Many weapons fall under two categories (for instance, most crossbows are both tactics and survival), so that you can wield multiple weapons using a single upgrade path.

You've also got two slots for skills, which follow the same rules as weapons, but can be anything from traps, buffs, magic attacks, or pets. Pets are handy because (with the exception of the Owl) you can just summon them at the start of a level and let them do their thing. Most of the other skills are more powerful, but require you to actually remember to use them when they're available to get the most utility out of them - which can be a problem in the hectic frenzy of combat that is Dead Cells.

Everything in Dead Cells, from the music to the timed doors at the end of levels, pushes you to be a whirlwind of destruction, endlessly running forward to kill everything before you. It's actually not a horrible strategy - if you can accomplish it without getting hit.

Dead Cell's major claim to fame is it's extended game - specifically, its system of Boss Cells. Acting as a New Game+ system, each time you win the game under an increased number of Cells, you unlock a new Boss Cell. These increase the difficulty of the game - mostly by introducing harder enemies and reducing and/or removing the healing stations between levels. However, they also increase the number of scrolls available (which can drastically increase the damage of your weapons) as well as unlock how many cells can be spent on the Forge, which can increase the potency of weapons that you find on a run.

It's pretty much the perfect game for when you just want to go balls-to-the-wall killing some dudes for half an hour. Expect most runs to end in failure, but those runs that do not are some of the most amazing adrenaline highs you'll ever experience.",True
,148313947,"First off, I just like to preface that I've replayed this game many times over the years and this game is the perfect rogue like experience where its hard as balls, but every death felt justified and earned as it was mostly my fault. For people who are struggling with the first few floors, as the expression goes ""get gud"" because this game is easy to learn and master, I also guarantee that there's probably a play style for you given the vast amount of items and weapons you can collect.  Also the development team has accomplished so much considering how small the team is and this game sets a very high bar when it comes to metroid-vanias and souls-likes and it really sets itself apart from all the others.
I also have not played the castlevania DLC yet but i probably will play it here very soon as I've heard very good things about it.",True

,148040289,"Great game overall.  The majority of the gameplay progression is exploring levels and finding items to better defeat enemies and bosses.  The player has some agency in routing through the dungeon by picking pathways that lead to predetermined ""biomes"" (i.e. If one wanted, one could go through the poison swap every run or the castle gates etc.).  The gameplay itself is very rewarding, with items and weapons all feeling fairly unique and having mechanics that encourage a certain style of play on a per item basis.  For example, the Baseball Bat deals more damage to stunned and rooted foes, so you seek out items that can stun and root foes, making combat be a setup for combos.  Simple but effective. 

I think most people who enjoy roguelites in general would enjoy this game.  If that's you, then give it a go. The DLC is not required to enjoy the base idea of the game, but they absolutely enhance the experience if you find the base game enjoyable. 


This below is mostly just a rant, which is not well written and you can reasonably ignore. I just had to b*tch:

My biggest, and really only, gripe is the platforming.  Most of the times it is benign, mostly acting as a medium to facilitate the combat more interestingly.  At other times there are small, mandatory platforming sections throughout levels that can be fairly dangerous, but these are mostly manageable as well.  However, there are some ""optional"" platforming sections one needs to complete to unlock additional items or to obtain additional scrolls that increase your damage.  And I write ""optional"" because I can't imagine the game expects me to NOT attempt to get the ""fancy dinner jacket"" outfit for my character.  Furthermore, on higher difficulties, not going out of your way to grab additional damage scrolls can make the run significantly more difficult, especially since damage scales exponentially in this game. The game does not offer really any items to affect one's platforming ability, so one just has to be good at the game, which is fine in its own right.  But I'm not playing Super Meat Boy where I can just retry a level.  Some runs take me, and I might just be a poor player, 30 to 50 minutes to get back to these ""optional"" sections.  And the game isn't a necessarily difficult platformer like SMB either, but it is just infuriating to lose a long run because I missed an unintuitive jump too many times.  And I have only died perhaps a few times to each ""optional"" section compared to bosses or mobs, but it is exceptionally demoralizing comparatively.  Get rid of this crap, man.  If the items don't really affect my ability to complete some challenge in a *roguelite* then that challenge shouldn't exist or should not be able to jeopardize my run.",True

,148111229,"Dead Cells is an absolutely great game, however it does have a few flaws.

The game itself is incredibly difficult (or it may just be the fact that im bad at video games), as it took me 250 runs to beat the Hand of the King (final boss) in normal mode. Getting to the hand, is no easy task, as you will have to go through a series of difficult biomes filled with deadly enemies (and jam-packed with a bunch of items from bows to shields to swords and even grenades). Bosses are one of the easier elements of the game however. For example, the first boss you encounter, the Concierge is very easy to dodge and predict its attacks. Dead Cells is a great game that requires practice, if you want to even get far. The rogue-like element to the game makes it one of the most punishing games i have ever played.

Same with Malenia plus the added waterfowl dance which makes the fight more frustrating than fun.)

It was worth buying at full price for the shear amount of layered content packing into one title. My main drive was collecting the armor, weapons and spells I came across.

I'm so torn between hating the staged fights and the exploring every inch of the map to discover some hidden item. I would have enjoyed the game more if they left out the over sized boss mechanics. Fixed attacks clipping through solid objects and invisible walls when targeting the player!

My friends pressured me into continuing to play this game, and I finally started to enjoy the game for what it was. It began being fun to have something to work towards, and become much better at the game. (in all aspects) 
The bosses and mechanics in this game are something.. interesting to say the least. Takes a long time to get used to, and I've spent multiple days and weeks on one boss. Nothing better than finally beating a boss and the relief going by.

The game is enormous, beautiful, and so many different areas to roam and find new items.

Edit: after beating the game

The game has it's flaws, some parts are notoriously hard like Melenia but over all the game has a huge fun factor that is not found in most modern games, 10/10 would recommend!

Edit After over 250 Hours of playing,

Turns out Most bosses including Melenia are actually easy to beat if you use the right equipment and tactics, which only now adds tons of repeatability to the game to try different combos and methods to beat bosses with!

This is now my first game that I have 100% gotten all the achievements for, and I still crave more, and I have not even modded the game yet which makes me even more hyped for starting another play through, but I want to wait for the DLC before starting another New Game +.",True

,148888250,"Absolute embarrassment of a triple AAA company in terms of PC compatibility. I spent 2.2 hours in the tutorial just trying to figure out broken keybinds. Why in the heII would I want F binded to jump, then you can never jump and use D to go to the right. And thats not the only key, Capslock, Windows keys, Function Keys, and some random keys like G or T depending on your PC peripherals. This game doesnt even register my G502X mouse. Therefore if I wanted a keybind on my mouse I have to pick some random ass key on the keyboard thats not blocked and then inturn bind that to my mouse on my mouses software. This makes dual keybinds useless. 

At my time of righting this 10/25/23 I looked up sells on this game, 20 million units + at the beginning of 2023, at 60 dollars a copy that comes out to 1.2 billion. A billion dollar triple AAA company that limits FPS to 60, as another comment said, limits screen resolution to normal 16:9, beyond broken keybinds for PC, and no widescreen support among other things. 

I truly don't understand why this game is rated so high, I bought this game because of the rating and I cant return it because I went .2 hours over the trial period just trying to fix there game. And yes for anyone wondering if you can mod the game and fix the issues of widescreen or keybinds etc. Yes you can, but according to what I've read you can be banned for it. 

One random person can implement a mod fix for a triple AAA studio that they can't seem to do theirself and its against the terms and policy. My play hours may go up after righting this but its only because I can't return it for going 12 minutes over the ""trial period.""",False

Became famous - being reported by 9/10 players trying to be support shows you are adored by your team and the enemy's

Became tolerant - ""Mid or Feed"" they say... I guess people are nice, they give you two options instead of just going mid.

Became social - Parents abandoned me, I had to learn how to sell myself to get a sugar daddy

but you will still play it anyway. you will find a time where you will ragequit and uninstall amd stare at your library of games as the creeping realizatiom sweeps over you that you not playing dota 2 will not effect the universe in a smallest way. will have no conceiveable effect on anything, you will be filled with a sudden dread that nothing you do matters and life has no meaning. Basiclu, the same feeling when you play dota 2. and dota 2 will be your only distraction from this dessicated husk of life. so the next day you will find yourself drawn back into it like a moth to a flame, starving off the moment when you will have to face your demon as long as you can. you will probably die alone some day and nobody gonna remember how high your mmr was.

First of all: its addictive af, its fun at the beginning you will like it farming winning losing going hard carry etc.. but as soon as you get more than 200 hours on record, gg cancer EVERYWHERE. Ive played dota, lol, cs go and many more games and believe me: dota is the most cancerous game to ever exist. If you are reading this, save a life, share it with a friend, cancer awarness.

",True
,29661271,"In Dota 2 your objective is to desroy the enemy's ""ancient"" which is essentially a big tower.  To get to the ancient you have to destroy your way through four tiers of towers which are defended by the enemy team.  At the same time, you are defending your ancient.
The character models, spells and all around feel of the game are what keep me coming back, however the MMR system is complete garbage, the community is nasty, the devs punish you with low priority queue (Must play shit games with shit people with a character you don't choose) and the MMR (Match Making Rating) system never resets.
There are no leagues, so you can't feel like you're progressing in any other way than points and skins for your characters.  

Why do I mention no MMR reset being a negative factor?  Because if you unfortunately get too low of a rank at any point you enter the ""Spiral of death"".  You will be queued primarily with people who don't speak english and who have never played the game before.  
There is no reason someone who plays 4000 hours in a game should ever be paired with a teammate who is on his first day and doesn't know anything about the game.  However, exactly that will happen.
Once you're in this spiral of death it's nearly impossible to get out.  I've had games where I got 30 kills, 1 death, 14 assists and we still lose because the other 4 players are feeding insanely. 

The whole experience could be made much better by simply having seasons where the  MMR resets.  However, the dev's couldn't give two shits about that.  Their entire interest is to get you to buy skins and battle passes.  I've tried to contact the devs over the years on many occasions but never get any response.  And for that, they deserve a bad review.

====================================
Well look at that.  Years and many posts and tweets later -- Dota 2 has leagues with a seasonal MMR Reset.  It only took them 5 years longer than it should have, with me ramming the suggestion into every inbox they had, including facebook for years on end.

Good job dev team. You finally listened to your lord and saviour (me).

,29492978,"Dota 2 is Valve's MOBA title, which is to say it's a real-time strategy game where you literally play the one single map over and over again, but you play as one of 700 characters that in other RTS games would be lategame units or lynchpins of a player's entire army, individual games can take hours, and there's a shop/inventory system for some reason. As a couple of my friends put it, half the features are bugs that got left in because the dev liked them; it's a horrifying mess with a skill floor that starts where other games have a ceiling, and a skill ceiling that may or may not exist.

(Also, the lore depicts the battle represented in the game as a final cataclysm between good and evil that will destroy the world no matter who wins, which is amusing to think about considering how many times it's been played out by the game's millions of fans.)

Taken altogether, Dota 2 seems very much like a product of people who got so incredibly attached to one very particular experience that they built everything else around it - and this is the important part - warts and all. People apparently spend massive amounts of time and money on what is essentially a glorified Warcraft III mod that itself has many mods, though, so it at least proves the viability of game modding.

This is also the product that's mainly responsible for killing the old Valve, the one that produced quality games on a semi-regular basis. Thanks to the massive popularity of Dota, and to an extent Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Valve was content to sit on their butts iterating on them while screwing around with VR and reaping that store/market/microtransaction money for an entire decade before they managed to stop pretending the franchise that made them didn't exist and release Half-Life: Alyx.

I at least liked the snazzy main menu and the Half-Life 2 doot noises. Inclusion of the Counter-Strike AWP firing noise on the other hand just bewildered me.",False

,30054536,"This is review for 2020 from perspective of pos 4 player that playes with team members only so this review is more about the competetive side of dota then your casual ranking.

Pros:

-much faster gameplay then it used to be

-with full squad Its still as fun as it used to be

-being one trick pony pays off more

Cons:

-Solo players and team players are 2 different species. If we play in a squad of 4, the random guy most of the time has no idea what is team play.

-Meta play got worse. What I mean by that is, that if you dont play meta heores, you will f*cking lose no matter how good of a player you are. In team vs team games Its all about game strategy, not individual skill and there is not much space for creativity because the op heroes are really op and average heroes are just not good enough.

-Jungle drops after 40 mins are unbalanced, some are really trash in every situation compared to others.

-most meta heroes are not fun to play all the time. Like who the f*ck enjoys playing Viper every game?

-Repetetive gameplay due to the need to pick the same 15 heroes all the time if you want to win.

-RNG, but I mean, that was there since the beginning but its getting progressively worse. Yea, Iam looking at you Ogre.

Conclusion :

I havent played solo in a few years but when it comes to full squad 5 on 5, It got more boring because at higher levels, you have to pick the same shit all the time, which is not fun, or you will lose, which is also not fun.

Fun if you play like 4 games per week, play more and Its boring.",False

Ive spent some years playing league of legends too and ive seen how the community grew more toxic because of young immature players. Dota2 community unfortunately runs toward the same path, as dota1 veteran who plays Dota2 such as me lose faith in the community and lack of humanity. but as of today i still play the game with great passion as if i was playing Dota1 except all my team and enemy team are muted. In out of 50 games, there is only a 1 game where i unmuted my team because they communicate to win and collaborate as a team.  I love the game its a part of me you cant take away every match brings back a lot of good memory so no matter how bad the game is no matter how we clearly lose the game no matter how bad my team i still treat them the best i could i never quit  it never affects me because when i enter the match i become the hero i pick with a goal to win with or without a team to help me, but the community...its a trash more so if you play solo but im not removing the fact that there are humane players among the community.

,148682938,"If you haven't played this game, you owe it to yourself. It's one of the best written and immersive stories I've played in gaming. Geralt is such a great character. The rest of the cast, DLC included, is also a highlight. This is one of those games that justify being semi-open world. There's so much to do, but not only that, almost everything ends up in unexpected ways. It's a fantastic experience, however, I do have to warn new players cause that happened to me, so here are my bullet points:

* Even though the games makes an effort to introduce characters from the books in a digestible, it not always sticks the landing. Expect to read the glossary or wikis to get the full context. This might throw some players off. It's not necessary to have played the previous games or read the books, nevertheless, the Witcher 3 regards legacy players.

* White Orchard (the first area) is not well paced at all. It's long and the systems are not described well enough, thus it is easy to get lost. On top of that, it's a slow burner of a game. I encourage you to continue playing until you reach the bloody baron. At the risk of sounding like a typical obsessed fan: the game does get better after the 10 hour mark. 

* The combat is awful. Get used to dodge/roll/parry and then attack, depending on the enemy. Igni is your best sign so use it a lot. I do recommend using potions early on since Blood and Wine (the last dlc) is very potion/oil oriented. Get used to it during the main game or Heart of Stone. You'll thank me laters.

Overall, as I said, a fantastic experience. Although it's not one that will be enjoyed from the moment you boot up the game. Give it time and you'll find yourself in a game you will not want to put down until the very end.",True

I really needed a new type of game in my library and honestly I got tired from all of these shooting games that are on the market rn. The Witcher 3 was a really refreshing experience and I just can't put it down. I don't have much freetime these days as I used to have, but I really enjoy spending most of it with this game.

,139935445,"I will leave this analysis completely spontaneously and from the foundation of the soul. Many games have influenced me and made me fall in love with them since childhood, but very few have moved my heart and spirit so much. I think this is the main purpose of art, it is to create an emotional manifest in a unique way in each being. The Witcher 3 is not only possibly the greatest game in gaming history, it is possibly the greatest masterpiece you will ever experience in an in-game virtual world. 

If we take all the foundations that make up a work, like a perfect cinema movie, we will evaluate soundtrack, photography, story/plot, dialogues, characters, costumes, sound, intensity, immersion, and so on. Well, you'll simply find everything here in this game, at such an exorbitant and impeccable level that it's even difficult to conceive how it was made, planned, thought and executed. Conclude the game, scrutinize it to the fullest, not only doing secondary Quests, but everything possible and I reach a final verdict here. 

The Witcher 3 is the best game in my life, it is the game that will move you in every possible way, it will make you cry, laugh, nurture joy, inspire, including for your own personal life. The complete experience of this game will make you reflect and look for something more in your life, live a great remarkable story full of adventures and wonderful stories. All this for a measly few of bucks, so stop buying crappy new poorly made game for expensive price, and be a grateful person for the rest of your life for finding my comment and having lived a once-in-a-lifetime experience (if you've never played). Do I recommend? I recommend it for people who want to live great stories in their lives.

Vou deixar esta análise de forma totalmente espontânea e do alicerce da alma. Muitos jogos me marcaram e me fizeram me apaixonar desde a infância, mas pouquíssimos mexeram tanto com o coração e o espírito. Acho que esse é o principal intuito da arte, é criar um manifesto emocional de forma única em cada ser. The Witcher 3 não é só possivelmente o maior jogo da história dos jogos, ele é possivelmente a maior obra artística que você poderá experienciar num mundo virtual in-game. 

Se pegarmos todos os alicerces que compõem uma obra, como um filme perfeito do cinema, nós avaliaremos trilha sonora, fotografia, história/enredo, diálogos, personagens, figurino, som, intensidade, imersão, e assim por diante. Bom, você simplesmente encontrará tudo aqui neste jogo, num nível tão exorbitante e impecável que é até difícil de conceber como foi feito, planejado, pensado e executado. Conclui o jogo, esmiucei ele ao máximo, não só fazendo Quests secundárias, como tudo que é possível e chego num veredito final aqui. 

The Witcher 3 é o melhor jogo da minha vida, é o jogo que vai te emocionar em todos os sentidos possíveis, vai te fazer chorar, rir, nutrir alegrias, inspirar, inclusive para sua própria vida pessoal. A experiência completa deste game fará você refletir e buscar por algo a mais na sua vida, viver uma grande história marcante cheia de aventuras e histórias maravilhosas. Tudo isso por míseros 20 reais, então para de comprar porcaria de jogo novo mal feito por 400 reais, e seja uma pessoa grata pelo resto da vida por encontrar meu comentário e ter vivido uma experiência única de vida (caso nunca tenha jogado). Se recomendo? Recomendo para pessoas que querem viver grandes histórias em suas vidas.

,148602236,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a masterpiece, but you already knew that. What you might not know is that it's not just a game; it's a life simulator, a monster masher, and a Gwent addiction all rolled into one. Geralt, our white-haired, gruff-voiced hero, manages it all with the style of a medieval James Bond.

Pros:

Gorgeous landscapes: If you're not pausing to take in the breathtaking vistas of Toussaint or Skellige, are you even playing The Witcher 3?
Gwent: It's like the Pokemon of the Witcher world, and I gotta catch 'em all! Why save Ciri when you can build a deck and play Gwent with random strangers for hours?
Beards: Geralt's beard growth is like a plant that only grows when you're not looking at it. Don't blink, or you'll miss his five-o'clock shadow.
Roach: She's the best horse, the worst horse, and a teleporting horse all in one. Roach, you magical enigma!
Cons:

Witcher senses: Ever wanted to feel like a detective in a world where every crime scene is conveniently marked with a glowing red trail? Welcome to Witcher vision!
Bathing optional: Geralt will slay monsters, woo sorceresses, and conquer empires, but he just won't take a bath. It's like he's allergic to soap.
Romance complications: Trying to please both Triss and Yennefer is like trying to juggle flaming swords while riding a unicycle. Choose one and brace for a fury fiercer than any beast in the game.
In summary, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is the game that proves you can save the world, win Gwent tournaments, and be an epic lover all in a day's work. But most importantly, it's a lesson in multitasking: fight a griffin, play Gwent, get the girl. Just don't forget to wash behind those witcher ears.",True

[b] ABOUT | [/b] Geralt of the Rivia in the Witcher III, is assigned to track his law of surprise child. Ciri was hunted down by Eredin, the king of Wild Hunt.

[b] STORY: [/b] Can’t describe it. You have to feel it yourself how amazing the adventure of Geralt is. It is a rich story game with a bunch of plots that has every consequences. Every choice will decide the ending of the game. Sometimes you can choose, sometimes you do have any choices. There is no a good or bad decision, it is all on you. 
 
[b] GAMEPLAY: [/b] A great hack and slash game with a lot of combinations. You have two swords, signs, mutagen ability and utility that will accompany you through the entire game. Every aspect for combat in this game is important to be mastered. 

[b] GRAPHIC: [/b] Excellent, beautiful, and stunning visual.

[b] ACHIEVEMENT: [/b] All achievements can be gained through most of the time, but you need a lot of efforts. I finished the achievements within 270 hours. 

[b] PROBLEM: [/b] The next-gen update of the Witcher 3 is really stunning, but it will cost you a higher gear. I tried the classic version of the game that can be obtained through properties-betas-classic version. It has a better and stable performance if you have decent gear.

,148545149,"MY FAVORITE GAME OF ALL TIME

The Witcher 3 is an absolute masterpiece in the world of video games. From the moment I started playing, I was completely immersed in its rich, detailed world. The depth of the storytelling is unparalleled, with a gripping narrative that kept me engaged for hours on end. The character development is exceptional, with each character feeling fully realized and integral to the overall plot.

The game's open-world environment is breathtaking, with stunning landscapes that truly bring the game to life. Whether it's navigating through the dense, dark forests or exploring the bustling cities, every corner of the world feels meticulously crafted and teeming with life. The attention to detail is remarkable, from the intricate design of the armor and weapons to the subtle nuances in the behavior of the NPCs.

The combat system can be seen as quite simple and bland, but I think its fluid and satisfying, offering a perfect balance between strategy and action. The variety of monsters and enemies keeps the gameplay fresh and exciting, with each encounter presenting a new challenge that requires careful planning and skillful execution. Especially when playing on the hardest difficulty ""Death march"", that in my opinion makes the game shine the most. 

Moreover, the game's side quests are not mere fillers but engaging stories in their own right, often with unexpected twists and meaningful consequences that impact the overall narrative. The choices presented to the player are morally complex, making every decision feel weighty and consequential. I would repeatedly be stuck at many different choices during my different playtrues. 

It's a rare gem that combines exceptional storytelling, breathtaking visuals, and immersive gameplay seamlessly. With its rich lore, compelling characters, and unparalleled attention to detail, The Witcher 3 stands as a pinnacle of the RPG genre and sets a standard that few other games can hope to achieve. It's an experience that lingers long after the game is turned off, leaving a lasting impression that few games can match. Even got me, as a non-ordinary reader to read all the Witcher books and furthermore, play the previous games. Moreover, I would replay the Witcher 3 occasionally every year because its just so fun to jump back into! I would highly recommend this game to anyone, especially when its often on sale for a bargain of a price.",True

Things that I wanna see in the next witcher game will be better horse riding mechanics. In The Witcher 3 it felt clunky and annoying. Also the player movement, Geralt's movement feels clunky as well not so bad as the horse's but still it can definetely be improved.

,148535369,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - A Riveting Tale That Defies Genre Conventions

In an industry often besieged by formulaic sequels and uninspired narratives, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt stands as a towering testament to the power of immersive storytelling in the gaming world. CD Projekt Red's magnum opus isn't merely another entry in a popular franchise; it's an expansive, deeply engrossing journey that defies the constraints of its genre, weaving a complex narrative tapestry that resonates long after the final credits roll.

At the heart of The Witcher 3 lies a narrative so intricately woven that it transcends the boundaries of video game storytelling. This isn't your typical hero's journey; it's a deeply human exploration of complex moral dilemmas, political intrigue, and the blurred lines between good and evil. The game's masterful storytelling allows players to navigate morally ambiguous choices, presenting a nuanced world where every decision has far-reaching consequences, making it one of the most captivating and intellectually stimulating narratives in modern gaming.

The game's meticulously crafted open world of Temeria is a visual and atmospheric marvel. From the sun-drenched fields of Velen to the hauntingly beautiful Skellige Isles, each locale is painstakingly detailed, brimming with life, and steeped in rich lore. The depth of the world-building is nothing short of remarkable, immersing players in a living, breathing realm where every corner tells a story and every character carries a weight that goes beyond their scripted lines.

Moreover, the expansion packs, ""Hearts of Stone"" and ""Blood and Wine,"" aren't mere cash-grabbing add-ons, but full-fledged narratives that rival the main game in both scope and emotional depth. They seamlessly integrate with the base game, offering new lands to explore, characters to meet, and stories to unravel, demonstrating a level of care and dedication to storytelling that is rare in the industry. CD Projekt Red's commitment to delivering substantial, story-driven content without compromising the game's artistic integrity is a testament to their respect for the player's experience and a stark contrast to the predatory practices seen in contemporary gaming.

Despite its occasional technical shortcomings, such as minor glitches and performance issues, The Witcher 3's ambition and attention to detail far outweigh its flaws. It demands patience and investment, rewarding players with a deeply satisfying and emotionally resonant experience that lingers long after the controller is set down. It's a game that transcends mere entertainment, leaving an indelible mark on the player's psyche and challenging the very notion of what a video game can achieve in terms of narrative complexity and emotional depth.

Furthermore, The Witcher 3's evocative musical score, composed by Marcin Przybyłowicz, with contributions from renowned folk band Percival Schuttenbach, serves as a powerful emotional undercurrent, enhancing the game's already immersive world. The haunting melodies and rousing anthems underscore pivotal moments in the narrative, evoking a range of emotions that further cement the game's ability to resonate on a deeply personal level. The synergy between the game's visuals, narrative, and musical score creates an atmospheric symphony that transports players into the heart of the Witcher universe.

In conclusion, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a seminal achievement in the realm of video game storytelling, offering a profoundly human and thought-provoking experience that elevates the medium to the realm of high art. It's not just a game; it's a transformative journey that reminds us of the power of interactive storytelling and the potential of the medium to provoke introspection and emotional resonance. For anyone seeking an unforgettable and deeply immersive narrative experience, The Witcher 3 is an absolute must-play that stands as a landmark in the evolution of video game storytelling.

,148496133,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a triumphant testament to the power of storytelling in video games, an epic journey that immerses players in a richly detailed world filled with unforgettable characters, breathtaking landscapes, and a narrative that keeps you engaged from the very beginning to the bittersweet end.

From the moment you step into the shoes of Geralt of Rivia, the iconic Witcher, you are thrust into a realm that oozes authenticity and originality. CD Projekt Red's creation is a masterclass in open-world game design, meticulously crafted and teeming with life. The Northern Realms and beyond are a testament to the developers' attention to detail, as each locale, whether a bustling city or a quiet village, feels alive with its unique culture, history, and inhabitants.

But what truly sets The Witcher 3 apart is its unrivaled storytelling. The game's narrative is a dark, gritty, and morally complex tale that grips your heart and mind, refusing to let go. The choices you make throughout the game have real consequences, affecting not only Geralt but the world around him. The choices are never simple, and they make you question your own morality and the shades of gray that exist in this cruel and unforgiving world.

The characters in The Witcher 3 are nothing short of extraordinary. Geralt, the grizzled monster slayer, is both relatable and enigmatic, a hero burdened by his own flaws. The supporting cast, including the charismatic bard Dandelion, the fierce sorceress Yennefer, and the enigmatic Ciri, all come to life with remarkable depth and complexity. Their interactions and stories are as compelling as Geralt's, making the game's world feel dynamic and engaging.

Combat in The Witcher 3 is a thrilling ballet of steel and magic. Geralt's array of combat styles, potions, and spells allow for diverse and strategic gameplay. The monstrous foes he faces are varied and challenging, each with its own set of weaknesses and tactics, making every battle a test of wits and skill.

The visuals in The Witcher 3 are nothing short of breathtaking. The game's graphics and art direction create an unparalleled atmosphere, making you feel like you've been transported to a world of knights, magic, and monsters. The weather effects, day-night cycle, and the interplay of light and shadow all contribute to the game's immersive beauty.

The game's soundtrack, composed by Marcin Przybyłowicz, is a symphonic masterpiece that perfectly complements the epic scope of the game. From the haunting melodies that play as you explore the Skellige Isles to the powerful, adrenaline-pumping battle themes, the music of The Witcher 3 is a key element in creating an emotional connection to the game.

In conclusion, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a triumph of storytelling, world-building, and character development. It's a game that not only sets a new standard for open-world RPGs but also demonstrates the potential of video games as a medium for immersive storytelling. With its breathtaking world, morally complex choices, and unforgettable characters, The Witcher 3 is a game that will be remembered as a classic for years to come. If you haven't embarked on this epic journey yet, do yourself a favor and dive into the rich and enthralling world of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. You won't be disappointed.",True

pros:

2) Impressive and extensive storyline that complements the books and previous games.
3) Medieval atmosphere that immerses you completely.
4) Really good English voice acting—far superior to the buggy and poor russian version.
5) Comfortable interface
cons: 
1) Casual fights, sigh abuse, roll abuse, potion abuse, etc. I completed the game on deathmatch mode very easily without side quests, potions, and rolling abuse. Only a few bosses gave me trouble, but after 2-3 tries, I passed them easily.
2) Rpg but without choices. There are only 3-4 major choices and that's all. Shame you had to pick 3 correct script choices to save Ciri, it's feels very stupid in the last cat-scene and that was the worst part of the game.

,148483090,"Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is not just a game; it's a masterpiece, an interactive magnum opus that deserves to be celebrated as one of the greatest achievements in the world of gaming. After spending 48.6 hours navigating the treacherous yet enchanting world of Geralt of Rivia, it's evident that this game has set a new standard for open-world RPGs.

From the moment you step into the shoes of Geralt, you are transported to a sprawling, meticulously crafted open world that is nothing short of breathtaking. The Northern Kingdoms are a sight to behold, featuring diverse landscapes, each with its own unique charm. The dense forests, rolling hills, bustling cities, and windswept Skellige Isles make every corner of the world feel authentic and alive.

The narrative in The Witcher 3 is a saga of unparalleled depth and complexity. As Geralt, a monster hunter with a moral code, you are on a quest to find your adopted daughter, Ciri, who is pursued by an otherworldly force known as the Wild Hunt. The narrative is more than just a story; it's an odyssey that explores themes of destiny, family, and the blurred lines between good and evil.

What sets The Witcher 3 apart is the attention to detail in character development and storytelling. Every character you meet feels fleshed out, with their own motivations, histories, and moral ambiguities. You are faced with moral choices, each with significant consequences, and the game's ability to blur the lines between right and wrong is nothing short of brilliant.

Gameplay in The Witcher 3 is a well-crafted fusion of action, RPG, and exploration. The combat system is refined, offering depth and challenge. Geralt's abilities and Witcher signs allow for varied approaches to battles, from swordplay to the use of powerful magic. Hunting down and defeating the game's vast array of mythical creatures is an adventure in itself.

Gwent, a card game within the game, is a brilliant addition, offering an engrossing and strategic diversion that can keep you entertained for hours. The game's expansion packs introduce more Gwent cards and quests, adding depth to the experience.

The side quests in The Witcher 3 are not mere diversions; they are compelling narratives in their own right. Each quest feels like a story, with its own moral dilemmas and emotional weight. You can spend hours exploring the game's vast world, uncovering hidden stories, and helping or harming its inhabitants.

The game's audio design is another standout feature. The hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, composed by Marcin Przybyłowicz, adds depth to every moment, from the tension of combat to the melancholy of exploration. The voice acting is top-notch, with Doug Cockle delivering a performance that brings Geralt to life.

In conclusion, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a work of art in the gaming world. After 48.6 hours of immersion, you've likely just scratched the surface of what this monumental game has to offer. It's an epic that defies expectations, delivering an unparalleled experience in storytelling, character development, and world-building. The game's refusal to shy away from the complexities of morality and human nature sets it apart, making it not just a game but a journey that will stay with you long after you've put down the controller. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a testament to the power of storytelling in gaming, and it deserves to be celebrated as a true masterpiece.",True

,148330046,"As a kid, I had a very dark soul, and the shadows of loneliness enveloped me. My solitary existence was my constant companion, leaving me feeling like an outsider in a world that I perceived as unrelentingly harsh. My solace came from Limp Bizkit's music, whose angsty tunes resonated deeply with my troubled soul. Fred Durst's raw and emotional lyrics were the soundtrack to my life, speaking to the darkness that consumed me.

But then, I discovered Dark Souls Remastered on Steam, a game that would alter the course of my journey. Just like Limp Bizkit's intense music, the game plunged me into a world of shadows, challenging me at every turn. It felt like I was confronting the abyss within me, just as Limp Bizkit's lyrics had done for years.

The brutal difficulty and relentless enemies in Dark Souls Remastered taught me lessons that Limp Bizkit's music couldn't. It was a reflection of my own life – failures, setbacks, and relentless struggles. And much like Limp Bizkit's music, the game showed me that even in the darkest moments, there are glimpses of light.

The game's intricate level design and hauntingly beautiful landscapes hinted at the hope that I'd never allowed myself to see before. It was as if Fred Durst's lyrics had come to life in the game, reminding me that even the darkest souls have pockets of brightness.

Just like Limp Bizkit's music served as my therapy, Dark Souls Remastered became my escape and a source of inspiration. It helped me confront the abyss within my soul and provided the strength to overcome it. I realized that, much like Limp Bizkit's music, there's redemption even in the darkest corners of life.

As I write this review, I can't help but draw parallels between my life, Limp Bizkit's music, and Dark Souls Remastered. They've all been essential in guiding me from darkness to light, proving that even the darkest souls can be remastered and can have spaces where it's bright and light sometimes.

TLDR: Limp Bizkit's music, like Dark Souls Remastered, shines a light on the darkest corners of the soul. Both have shown me that even the darkest souls can find redemption, just like Limp Bizkit's lyrics resonate in the darkest moments of life.",True

,148228373,"So the hours posted here are wrong. I've been playing this game way longer, but I originally was on Xbox. I actually have around 900 hours in this game, but regardless I'm not here to brag about playtime. I'm here to review one of my favorite games of all time, while also shitting on how this is a horrible remaster. This game, as a lot of people know, is absolutely amazing. From its interconnected world, to its methodical and intricate combat, this game is a joy. I don't want to go way too in depth over the game itself, as this is the REMASTERED version, not the original. All you really need to know is if you're considering Dark Souls, then buy it and give it a shot. Worst case scenario you can refund it if it's not for you! If this is up your alley, however, then prepare yourself for a magical experience until you kill O&S and it goes down to being just a pretty good experience (then it becomes a masterpiece then with Artorias of the Abyss). One other thing, though, this is a wiki game. Just like games like Terraria and Barotrauma, this game wants you to look at the wiki and learn about it, as it's super convoluted. Don't feel ashamed for checking out the wiki!
Anyways, onto the remastered part: it sucks. I wasn't lucky enough to get PtDE before it got delisted, but looking at comparisons they are next to the same thing given you install a performance mod for PtDE that is widely available and easy to use. If you own PtDE, this game is just as dead so don't bother getting it for the multiplayer. This was how I got started as a sunbro, but it's dead now just like the original.

But with each boss you kill, each enemy you slaughter, and with each time you yourself are ended. you will begin to learn the tells of a swing and the spacing of your sword. you will scrape at bosses until you grovel out a victory, you will make death runs until you can do it with your eyes closed, you will kill the same enemies over and over again. But for what you ask? It certainly is not fun to die and run back just to do it again. Well my friend, its when you first learn to parry the black knights, when you finally kill that one boss, when you find the coolest looking Armour, when you forge a great weapon out of souls and sweat, when after you have fought tooth and nail you come out on top.

I’m trying, but I feel as if the game punishes me for exploration. Combat is so rigid and tanklike, but not impossible. Still, every enemy does enormous damage and takes so many hit points to defeat. Took me a few tries to beat the first boss, but I did it. Everything after that has been so awkward. I meet skeletons, but fighting them is not worth it. What I’m reading about the game says it’s damn near impossible to conquer it without taking tips from the community, which tells me to avoid combat as much as possible and collect items instead. But what are these items? Why am I collecting them?

Why are minor enemies such a MAJOR EVENT to fight? Challenge stems from the clunky combat controls instead of anything deliberate. When I die, often it’s because the game didn’t respond when I wanted to roll, or didn’t block when I pushed the button. So far I’m not enjoying this, all of these stats and items. Why can’t I assign a throwing item to a quick slot for easy use? I can’t explore without facing enemies I can’t defeat. I can’t fight. I can’t outrun most of the enemies. What am I doing?

The whole game seems to be built around the idea of respawning: the game will kill you over and over, but that’s ok because you can just go back and figure out how to proceed from there.

,148104093,"An undeniable amazing game of it's time, and still an unforgettable game 13 years later. Although the game severely falls flat in the egregiously unfinished second half of the game (Not including DLC). The bosses are rushed, the enemies are boring, and the level design is either unnecessarily frustrating or just plain out ridiculous. Don't let that take away from the experience of the game as a whole, the entirety of the first half of the game is near perfect, the soundtrack throughout stays consistently top of the line, and a memorable art/designs direction.

It's important to also take into account that this game is supposed to be a 'remaster', which is an absolute disgrace and money scam. It's a port with a a remaster on the price tag. 

Aside from the what i previously stated about the latter half of the game, the rest of the game is the exact opposite. An ingeniously connected overarching map, extremely hard but CONSISTENTLY fair enemies and bosses, innovative combat and movement, and an unforgettable experience.

As a essentially the father to the souls series, it's impossible to not notice the influence this game has had on the gaming industry as a whole. If the team had more budget to finish the second half of the game, this game would be a goddamn masterpiece. I would highly recommend a try.

It's very fun and worthy of spending many days on to fully complete its storyline and maybe even go above and beyond with the achievements. I will admit, however, I feel like there's a lot of functions in this game that's left unexplained and likely will leave the player to have to research things. There are a few places you need to go that can't be unlocked until you get certain things (which aren't specified), in order to cast pyromancies/miracles/sorceries you need to have the appropriate conduit wielded (which wasn't explained), the stats at the start aren't elaborated on nor is there really an option to see what they affect, and I had no idea until about halfway into my first playthrough that there are different paths you can ascend your weapons to (i.e. lightning, magic, fire, etc.). So unless you know a lot about Dark Souls in advance before playing, you may have some trouble figuring some things out throughout the game. However, these downsides are not enough to get me to dislike the game. It was incredibly fun even with these quirks.

Well, that's changed this time around, I've finally beaten the game! It only took, what, 55 hours? I'm sure if I ever play it again, that it'll take maybe half the time. 

My thoughts on the game are vastly different than they were when I was playing this on my old 360; I had thought the game was wayyyy too difficult. Now I think that it's an experience of a game that most of everyone should play, or at least try to. The first half at least, the second half is certainly... Something. The whole game takes a noticeable drop of quality after Anor Londo, a criticism I'm sure that everyone under the sun remotely interested in DS1 has heard. If the entire game was built like the second half was, I'm sure that this game wouldn't have made as big of a ripple across the entire gaming scene as it did, in fact I'm positive it would have killed this entire series, and with it the souls-like genre.

,147939697,"Honestly, I fucking hate this game. It's my least favorite Fromsoft game that I've played. It's not necessarily a bad game but a large part of the difficulty meme for this specific game is based off of how janky everything is. Hitboxes and collision are insanely inconsistent, my character would randomly fall off of rounded surfaces during platforming segments and then there's wild things like enemies backstabbing you from the side while you're in mid-air. A lot of the maps in this game are horribly designed (fuck whoever designed Tomb of Giants) and some enemies are extremely unbalanced. I've played through DS1 multiple times and every playthrough feels the same, the game is hard and frustrating because of it's legitimate difficulty but a larger part of it is the poor design. It would  be nice to see this get a proper remake like Demon Souls received.

While I don't particularly like playing this specific entry in the Dark Souls series I have to admit that it's my favorite in terms of its plot and its significance in the overall DS continuity. I don't hate this game I just think it needs a lot of polishing before I would call it an amazing game. I'm glad future titles were more refined than the previous iterations.

,147932589,Git gud,True
,147929576,"[b]tl;dr[/b] - Play Dark Souls III, Elden Ring, Sekiro or Bloodborne instead.

Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed myself. This is a fun game that will certainly offer an experience you won't soon regret or forget. There's many interesting locations to explore, with a connected world that truly feels alive, and which brings all kinds of dark fantasy to life for you to enjoy.

That said, this game has aged like milk. The combat is clunky and at times unresponsive, and the difficulty of the game usually comes from being swarmed by a large group of enemies rather than any interesting combat mechanic.

Boss fights are surprisingly easy and just not very interesting. They're all too slow and pose very little threat compared to the swarm of enemies you've been fighting in the open world. The only three difficult boss fights include a coin toss in a tiny arena against some demon dude and two dogs, a not-so-fair 2v1, and a fight where the most used strategy is literally to save and quit.

Most of your time in the game will be spent running back to wherever you got killed, running pass everything and avoiding interacting with the game. You'll spend way more time just running back to your corpse or a boss arena than exploring or actually fighting anything, and it gets grating.

I couldn't tell you what the plot is about. Almost all important plot points are way too cryptic to understand at a glance, which is a shame because the stories this land has to tell are actually really interesting... too bad the game doesn't really want to tell you about them. A game shouldn't have to rely on fan content for you to make basic sense of its story.

[b]Don't make this your first Souls game[/b] and only play it once you've got some experience with future (better) games and only if you're curious to see where Dark Souls started. If your friend wants you to play this game blind, chances are they wanna see you suffer and have fun at your expense.

This game would break your soul, your controller and maybe even your monitor, and its worth each one of those things. its a once in a lifetime experience. To think that a game released 13 years ago, would not only stand up to modern gaming standards, but far surpass it, tells you all there is to know about this one.

the good - 

The NPCs of this game are some of the best ones i have encountered in any game. You almost start to connect with them and root for them to achieve their targets.

the combat is by far the best combat mechanics i have ever experienced. I was playing lies of P and dark souls side by side, and it is mind blowing how this 13 year old games combat matched, if not surpassed, the latest edition of soulslike on the market.

the bosses - some of the best. you need to strategise and analyse each one of them and plan your attacks accordingly. gives one a weird feeling of achievement for defeating a virtual enemy.



the bad -
that being said, the game is EXTREMELY frustrating. there are very few checkpoints and for some bosses you need to fight a dozen soldiers before you get a shot at them again. but its all about getting it.. once you get it - believe me this game would still beat your ass and humble you : D.

However, one game in the series always stood out as unique from the others--specifically, in that I hated it. For years, I not only considered Dark Souls 2 to be the weakest entry in the series, but also considered to be an outright bad, poorly designed game.

However, after hearing online that the true problems with DS2 lay in its ""remaster"", Scholar of the First Sin. So I gave Vanilla a chance, and I was shocked to discover that I absolutely loved my experience. The overwhelming ganks and thoughtlessly-placed enemies were nowhere to be seen. Instead, the game actually felt like it was designed to be a fair challenge, as opposed to a dogshit Kaizo Dark Souls ROM hack.

Is DS2 a perfect game? No. There are still weird choices such as the need to level up Adaptability, the bosses tend to go for quantity over quality and are all kind of clunky and too easy. The areas can be a bit bland, and the level design somewhat flat and forgettable. But Dark Souls 2 is still a really good game. You just gotta get this version--NOT Scholar.",True

,142949665,"I used to play this game quite a bit and I enjoyed it. But that was back when Dark Souls: PTDE was the only alternative which at the time still had major performance issues and was still using GFWL for online play.
Dark Souls 2 offered a stable experience and working online.

Something that Dark Souls 2 also had was better build variety. I remember playing Dark Souls 1 and trying to use the dragon bone fists and having a miserable time. But in Dark Souls 2 you could use whatever and still make it through the game without issues.

I did a lot of PVP in this game, probably more that I did in the other titles. I've heard people say that it has the BEST pvp, but to me it is not because the PVP is good but rather Dark Souls 3 and Elden Ring did a worse job with it. Even back in it's prime invasions outside of the main pvp areas were really rare, probably because people had to farm eye orbs, and those who didn't want to do that just stuck to the arena and bell towers.

I stopped playing after Dark Souls 3 came out and never came back until many years later to play with a few friends who had never played it before. 
Having stepped away from the game for a while and then coming back made me realize that I had ignored a lot of the flaws of the game just because the game offered a few things that Dark Souls 1 did not. But now that Elden Ring and Dark Souls 3 are around they also offer the same things, so now it's now longer unique to Dark Souls 2.

What unique things Dark Souls 2 had left are mostly negative.
Lets start:
-Level design isn't great. A lot of the areas are a pain to explore and a slog to get through. I've heard people praise the game for being non-linear but that really isn't true. It's true that you have some paths to choose in the first half of the game, but the paths themselves are pretty linear and the second half of the game is entirely linear.
- The bosses aren't so great. There quite a few bosses in this game and the average one is pretty mediocre with less than a handful being actually good. Even some of the major bosses are forgettable.
- Weapons are made of glass. Your weapons break very frequently.
- Armor isn't worth it. Armor provides very little protection against physical damage.
- Adaptability was a bad idea. No point in wearing lighter armor for more I-frames because you still need to level ADP anyway.
- General hitbox and reaction issues.

There's probably more that I can't think of right now.

There really isn't anything this game has to offer that makes the slog worth it. And it's a long slog.
I also feel like a lot of praise I hear for this game is either reaching really hard, being disingenuous, or outright false. I don't believe that this game is good let alone ""the best"" anything.

The starting classes kinda suck and the early game tutorial level doesn't help with the lacking inventory for example only one class starts with a shield but his weapon sucks another one doesn't even have the proper stats for his starting weapon (basically the starting loadouts are all lacking)

I love the bosses, lore, customization, and the areas as well as awesome, dark, menacing cutscenes. however...they missed some stuff in this game. feels some stuff was too easy, where other stuff was stupidly designed or the idea was poor. i'm specifically talking about curses/effigy's. it definitely was a 9/10 game for me up until after Drangelic Castle when I really hadn't taken the cursed health too much into account but it is a frustrating mech. while not impossible to deal with, definitely an annoyance. the purging stones and curses in DS1 were a lot cooler/better IMO but I see why they did it in this game. changes/fits the lore and ideals of the game better. understandable. the ending was fkn awesome...i give it 7.8/10. thanks again FS.

,142710002,"After trying Sotfs and utterly despising it, I'd heard that actually the vanilla game was better, for having less petrified npcs, less ganky enemy locations and a whole host of other things. And yes it is better.
It's still dogshit though: on my sotfs playthrough, I managed to get to the sinner's rise and couldn't kill the boss due to being massively under-levelled, and then couldn't progress any further due not having levelled adaptability (no guide run) and not having enough fragrant branches of yore to literally open up one of the mandatory routes. In this run, I got all the way to the Iron Keep and was making runs on Smelter Demon, it took me about 7 hours to get there due to the fact that life gems break the game's balance and let me first try every boss (and if you say ""don't use them then"", the game punishes you for using estus only due to how slow they are to use and actually heal you). Once making runs on the Demon I'd had it and finally did myself a favour and quit.
I could list all the minor - and major - complaints I have with this game but my biggest one is just that it's boring: the world is devoid of life, and not in the way that it should be in a Dark Souls game, I was always aware that I was playing the game, unlike in other FromSoftware games where I'm able to get into the world. Every area seemed to consist of one, two if lucky, or three at an absolute max bonfires and were so small that they weren't anything but just different textured pits where enemies could be put; there was no creativity to be found in them, the odd npc but even then they were all foreigners who had no tie to that area of the game. And on top of that, it seems that I'm dissuaded from actually engaging with the lore through item descriptions and so on because this game seems to want to hammer home the whole ""did you get it? did you get that nothing lasts for every? nothing lasts forever and you'll go crazy and the world doesn't make sense!"" line. What's the point of trying to learn about all the different kingdoms, Mirrah being one, only for you to know that the answer will just be ""it doesn't make sense isn't it so cool"".

,141942418,"DS2 is the least enjoyable out of the Soulsborne games made by Fromsoftware. 

It has some positives: build variety, interconnected levels with initial freedom, dual wielding, NG+ features. 

It has some odd choices: losing max health on death, ""physics"", clunky tutorial, life gems, no choice to start offline.

And it has some shi~~y things:  Adaptability, very 'videogamey' levels, inconsistent enemy design (scorpion people, elephant people, dwarfs, fire strippers, weeb knights.) Gank squad bosses, hoards of enemies plonked in the world to overwhelm you,  Copy/Paste DLC that doubles down on a lot of the negatives from the base game.

But that said it's still Dark Souls and if you've played and replayed all the others then you'll play this too.

Multiplayer is full of immortal cheaters so don't believe people who say DS2 has the best multiplayer.

Also i don't think the Scholar of the First Sin version is superior it's merely modified.

,142389504,"DS2 is.. unique. I think I enjoyed it more than the first. I definitely had a lot more fun mechanically.. but there are a few faults. 

For one, I played in offline mode which made getting through some parts of explorations dicey since having to do a certain thing to make a boss more bearable wasn't immediately obvious and caused me to have to run around lost for a good while. Also enemies stop spawning eventually unless you join a covenant to farm with, which was kind of annoying since I didn't figure that out until nearly done with the game and was starved for souls and materials later on.

My biggest gripe would come from the end of the 3rd DLC though, where they put you in a snowy biome and  then blind you with white for 30 seconds only to let you see for 3 seconds. All the while you're being bombarded by enemies that spawn in the snow-fog. They did give one location to figure out where to go though... in the form of a blinding white light on top of the blinding white snowstorm. \o/

,142258828,"What a pleasant surprise

My journey in this series started with Elden Ring. After that i played DS3 and DS1. I was a bit hesitant to buy DS2 because, well...it's by many considered to be the worst of the series. With the latest sale i thought ""what the hell - lets do this"" and bought it - and i am really glad that i did.

To be fair, the start of the game is a bit rough and for the first 1 or 2 hours i was not really happy with what i was playing. But the more i got into the (sometimes rather contrived) mechanics of the game, the more i enjoyed it. Even after finishing it, i'm still puzzled by some of its design mechanics, but those never ruined the gameplay experience for me. 

What really stands out to me in this iteration of Dark Souls are the visuals. The world of this game is beautiful with gorgeous vistas and sublime colour usage. I'm no saying the game looks cheerful in any way, but DS1+3 tend to be very dark and gloomy.  The soundtrack complements the feeling of those areas very well. The voice acting is also done at a very high standard - nothing to complain here.

Combat feels more like DS3 than DS1. Its a bit more fluid and responsive and usually works very well. Sometimes the tracking of attacks is rather weird, and the autotargeting will get you killed a few times. Movement feels good as well and the platforming which is sometimes expected of you is usually not an issue. 

Level and boss design is also pretty great most of the time. There is the occasional runback to a boss which gets annoying after a few times (especially since you can get hit while trying to traverse a fog-gate).  Overall i would say this game (without its DLCs) has probably the easiest suite of bosses whilst having some of the toughest dungeons/stages to master. I did enjoy the boss-fights though. No stupid mechanics or overly wonky hitboxes, no unfair deaths or other cheap tricks - just enjoyable combat which still punishes you if you fail to learn the mechanics. 

To sum it up, it's not a perfect game by any means and there are a few design choices which drag the gameplay experience down a bit. But after hearing and reading that DS2 is supposed to be a terrible or subpar game, i was really surprised how well this game plays. I really enjoyed my time with it and will probably return for another NG+ or 2.

,141448251,"Ater finishing this game my opinion of it changed, somewhat at least. 

I still think the beginning is just plain bad and game throws too much at you while you do not have access to tools to actually enjoy the gameplay. And that's around first half of the game.

But around middle to late game, game improves significantly in most areas. Storytelling gets a better direction and story begins to affect you, with some of the strongest beats in the series thus far (I have yet to play DS3). You also finally get tool variety to overcome challenges in creative ways and begin to form a very personalised build that you can actually defeat foes with. It has a lot of good elements, beneath the clunk, frustration and annoyance that sadly cannot be defended that is.

DLC Level design as well is immaculate, sadly bosses, except final ones, tend to disappoint. The ending is also really interesting after it all, though I think More npcs in DLCs would be welcome.

Overall, this game is in a weird place, where I would not recommend it for its extremely frustrating first hours and several locations seemingly made out of spite, but i would recommend it for (most of the) later half and clever structure it achieves then as well as sheer amount of gameplay customisability. I think the positives outweigh the negatives, but at the same time I doubt I will be doing a NG run again.

,141887581,"Dark Souls II feels like playing baseball with a familiar, worn-in, comfortable mitt, only the rules of the sport have been slightly tweaked. Anyone worried that the sequel might rein back on the difficulty in favor of targeting a wider audience can sleep easy tonight – Dark Souls II is every bit as punishing, demanding, and ultimately rewarding as its 2011 predecessor. Its new ideas for both single-player exploration and helping and tormenting others in multiplayer don’t always quite click, but enough do to make this an exceptional game and an irresistible challenge.

As a person who earned both the ""To Link the Fire"" and ""Dark Lord"" endgame Achievements in the original Dark Souls, I have no shame in admitting that Dark Souls II put me down hundreds of times throughout the massive, 60-hour journey. But like the original, no death was ever in vain. Each moment of failure taught me more about how Dark Souls II works that helped me get better. From learning to exploit enemy attack patterns to picking up the signs of environmental traps, the high difficulty almost never felt insurmountable.

I say “almost” because developer From Software went a little too far with a penalty that decreases your max HP every time you die. This can be counteracted by using a Human Effigy, but those items are few and far between in the early half of the campaign. While undoubtedly a hardcore feature, I found it frustrating because it slightly stifled my urge to explore the world with a fear of being too harshly penalized for failure. True, this system is similar to how it was in Demon's Souls, but I'm a much bigger fan of how the original Dark implemented it.

But I pushed through and was rewarded for it, because the sprawling and diverse world of Dark Souls II proves to be ripe for non-linear exploration. One of my favorite elements here is that you always have at least a handful of different routes through the world at your disposal. Stuck at haunted dock full of fire-wielding marauders? Well, you can work your way down a well and find a tomb full of talking rats. Can’t get past a particularly tricky boss? Maybe head down another path to the Shaded Woods instead, and come back once you've leveled up.

The world of Drangelic is massive and filled with a wide variety of different locales. You'll travel between crumbling seaside kingdoms to marshes layered with thick coats of poison to what feels like the bowels of hell itself. While the variety in places to fight and explore is great, the world of Dark Souls II lacks a certain cohesion that was present in the original. 2011's depiction of Lordran felt it made sense in a geographic sense -- no matter how fantastical the setting got, it all seemed to fit together naturally. With the variety here and the ability to fast travel on a whim, Dark Souls II feels more like a large collection of levels than one natural single world.

Despite this schism, it’s definitely a nice world to look at. Dark Souls II's updated engine emphasizes the role of lighting in exploration. The game looks gorgeous when you're roaming around outside in a naturally lit area, or carrying around a torch. At any bonfire, you can choose to remove your shield in favor of lighting a torch. Not only does having a flame in your hand illuminate dark corners, but some enemies will cower in fear before your light. A choice that makes such a visible impact is cool, but oddly enough, the torch creates a strange tradeoff. Do you want to play it safe and carry a shield, or risk death and create a more visually interesting experience?

But these lighting conundrums don’t take away from just how great it feels to play Dark Souls II. It builds upon the challenge, scope, and mystery of the original in so many different impressive ways. While it looks great on 360 and PS3, it's particularly gorgeous on PC. The improved textures, lighting, and minor environmental effects like the way wind whips through the grass make it one of the most visually impressive games I've ever played.",True

The adaptability stat is pretty much required for dumping a few levels as it improves dodging and healing animation speed, but you would have no way of knowing that on your first playthrough. However the most infuriating part of this game is the boss runs. There are some fun and cool boss fights in this game, but there is no fun to be had from running long distances over and over again through an army of mobs that can easily kill you if they get a hit in as you run by. Some boss fights are hard or annoying only because of what you have to go through to get back to them if you die (smelter demon, chariot, ruin sentinels, etc).

I don't think ADP is bad nor good, rather, it makes the game just different from the others, and I can understand the point of it.

But it seems like every animation was poorly made, from the basic walking & running ones to bosses and enemies' attacks. It feels weird and wouldn't be particularly bad if it wasn't a souls game, which requires a well-polished combat due to its intrinsic high difficulty. Also, I should add that the player character doesn't even move when hit...? (when it has enough poise to not get stunned) That made being hit something very confusing that many times made me check my HP bar to see if I was really hit or not...

Audio design is... Unfinished, it seems? A lot of actions do not have any audio and a lot of important sounds seem like they're just placeholders until something better was made, like the running sound that seems very generic and even attacks from bosses that do not have sound at all.

,10090126,"The first summarized feeling that I can express is that it seems to be bigger and a bit longer than original; but to my suprise Steam's statistic shown nearly exact same number of 66 and 62 hours for sequel and first installment respectively.

Before we go further I must warn you, that this comes from PVE-carebear who finished this game once and has no intention to do all those crazy NG+ stuff like many hard-core fans seemingly would. I died… well I can't really say a lot, but that's mostly because I summoned two phantoms for every boss and high-faith-lightning-spears-throwing build seems to be incredibly overpowered for beating AI. And I switched to it immediately after things got a bit tough. 

Before that I approached the same leveling as I did in first game: lots of strength and relying on heavy two-handed weapon (I bouth Pursuer's Ultra Greatsword). That was halfway through the game if you're wondering. I already killed Old Iron King, did both Belfrys, and made it through the Warf, Forest and Bastille. I even finished Grave of Saints. Anyway, it was a pure-melee character. And I encountered those flaming lizards, you know them, probably, if you finished the game. They were hard for me. Like really hard. I did little to none damage to them, but a few tries and that rolling around did the trick: I killed the first one, and then the second one. Third one stomped me. The narrow passage, the death-bringing fire spits, the horros, the wrong time to drink Estus. You know how this happens. The whole way back from the bonfire I hoped that they are treated like mini-bosses, and don't respawn. They did. I realized that either I can spend another hour trying to beat what seems like the hardest challenge I met in the game or I can visit them later. Some poison-arrows, some ranged stuff, which I was lacking. And that's where things got interesting. Rather than finishing later there is third option in sequel, one which original lacked. You can just redistribute your spents souls. And my inventory was crawling with all kind of stuff suitable for caster. And in a thirty minutes I was newly-born battle-cleric.

That sweet feeling of smartly overcoming the problem is good enough for me. It may be not as challenging in terms of perfect reaction, precise directional control and ability to automate sequences of same movements, but it doesn't matter for me. What I like in metroidvanias is that little hidden secrets left by developers. And in that sense Dark Souls is a proud member of the genre. Hidden walls, locked doors, smart usage of enemy attacks for opening new passageway, vulnerabilities of certain enemys — and most of those things not only present you with another glimpse of actually rich lore but make you more powerful or capable with dealing with some problem. And that's it, you just have to think and look for clues.
Second game's world became a bit more widespread, more star-shaped like with a central hub, that's it. It feels slightly more sensible or easier to decipher, but and in a many ways sequel actually is. Ability to change character build was already mentioned. And then there's less-restrictive weapon upgrading, and special rings that increase your chance to be summoned by your friend rather than stranger. It never goes as far as forcing you to navigate through complete dark area with deadly cliffs all around. That was what first game did. And while I admire this non-compomising approach of the developers, it was not fun. Yes, you could actually find a source of light before heading there, but that was so obscure, that I didn't. And I seriously doubt anyone on first playthrough without a guide would. So Dark Souls II changed a lot of stuff, that wasn't fun. It still sometimes isn't, but at least it doesn't irritate, and that's good. 

It's steal hard to the limit, that I felt satisfaction beating it. It required time, dedication and work of thought. And it was worth it. It still is in a lot of ways beautiful. With that oblique beaty, that you won't find on the first look. This style develops with progressing in the game, rather than trying to blaze all guns at you at the first second. Of course it's technically crappy, and some locations look even horrible, but the overall design atones it all. It comes a long way from minimalism to grotesque staying true to itself and game atmosphere. And despite all transformations it never looks like an eclectic mess.

This post-apocalyptic fantasy world is still deep, depressing and has a lot of history it doesn't really want to share. Or at least it won't if you won't work for it. But that's okay. That's how metroidvanias work.",True

If u like them u will like Dark Souls II. Graphic look cool, enemies gonna hit u hard, but they are beatable.",True
,120781526,"My main issues with the game are things such as the enemy placement, combat, bosses, its approach to difficulty, and world design. There will be some spoilers below, mainly boss names, area names, and intro spoilers.

Enemy placement:
This game has a lot of enemies in a lot of places that serve as a ""challenge"", rather than making the actual enemy placements and engagements challenging.

Combat:
This ties into the first point, because your weapon's durability drains so easily (whereas in DS1 it was an occasional issue and DS3 it's a non-issue) there's a very real chance you will be in the middle of a boss fight and your weapon just breaks. You either have to carry repair powder with you or you have to carry 2 weapons. There's a ring that mitigates this slightly, but combined with the health drain ring it basically makes it necessary to use 2 out of your 4 ring spots to be able to not be as punished for simply playing. Queueing up inputs is very inconsistent, they seem to randomly decide when to work and when not to work. At some points, there's a complete lack of feedback from getting hit. You'll see your health bar go down, but you won't hear a noise, you won't see any particles from your character or see your character affected in any way.

Besides that, I've found myself very often getting hit by an attack the frame after I stagger the enemy. I played with a Strength build for my first playthrough and very often I found myself going for a swing, hitting them, and then seeing my health bar drained a bit /anyways/ even though the enemy got staggered. Additionally, enemies traversing the boundaries of time and space so their attacks hit you when you roll behind them is very annoying.
There's also an issue with the AI being able to immediately attack the moment you go for a heal, I've seen clips of enemies literally going out of their death animations and killing a player.

Another issue is with the healing: Both the Estus Flask and the infinite supply of lifegems the game gives you which trivialises things a lot of the time. The Estus takes ages to consume and the health isn't instant but goes up slowly, this means that a lot of the time you'll start drinking at a time that it seems obvious you should be able to drink, but get smacked down instead. Lifegems simply trivialise healing, as you have access to an infinite supply (even early game). 

Bosses:
Now when it comes to bosses, it's very simple. There are a ton of bosses to the point where most of them don't really feel special anymore. They start becoming glorified enemies who have dedicated music and a big health bar. Out of the 32 bosses, 17 (arguably 18 or 19) are just fighting a humanoid with a sword. That's not counting multiple bosses in 1 arena as a separate boss (such as the 3 grave robbers or the Sentinels). The summons are also insanely terrible, they don't have a brain whatsoever. They run at the boss and hug it until they're dead. They just keep swinging, do terrible damage (they don't scale with NG level either), and just get themselves killed very easily.

The boss runs themselves are also some of the worst in the series, but can be partially mitigated by killing all the enemies 12 times, but it's incredibly boring to do so.

Approach to difficulty:
This is mainly the cause of the awful boss runs. This game's philosphy is ""people liked Dark Souls 1 because they died a lot, so let's kill the player constantly"" and it achieves this through gank squads, straight-up removing max HP on death, and the continuous invasions. 

The way this game treats difficulty is very obvious from the start, the intro cutscene talks about how you'll ""lose your souls over and over"". The achievement for dying is also called ""welcome to Dark Souls"" and it feels like the developers massively misunderstood what the difficulty in the game was meant for.

World design:
While I think this game has some really interesting places (Majula is the number 1 hub out of all the games, or the castle being visible throughout a large portion of the game), I think overall its world design leaves a lot to be desired. 3 examples I can think of is the placement of an entire castle changing when you go through a tunnel, going under sea level but somehow ending up at a pier, and going up an elevator (that you can't see from the outside) to a mountain with a big lava lake and castle (that you can't see from the outside).


""Quick"" points:

A lot of animations look weird and stiff and the movement feels off a lot of the time (both animation-wise for the player/enemies, but also when controlling). 

ADP and the i-frames tied to it may be the dumbest thing ever invented. Completely unnecessary. There's no benefit for this mechanic.


Every time you die, you lose 5% HP up to a maximum of 50%. This is just punishing for no real reason. From a quick Google search, this mechanic in Demon's Souls (as it's a PS-exclusive, I have not played it yet) seems to have a lot more of a purpose besides ""Here, get punished for no reason, you idiot"". Dying is one of the main ways to learn the games and its bosses, punishing you this heavily for dying is just contrary to the Souls series. As stated earlier, there's a ring to reduce this effect to 75%, however it requires you to use 1 out of your 4 ring slots . The fact that there are 4 ring slots means rings are much less powerful than in DS1 (understandably so), but then having 2 rings that are basically needed to have a decent experience means you are basically just running nerfed rings.

Alternatively, you can use Human Effigies (the DS2-equivalent of DS1's humanity and DS3's Embers) to completely remove it, but it's not like those are infinitely available like Lifegems. DS3 did this system way better with rewarding the player for using an Ember by giving them a lot of extra HP, but losing it upon death.

Multiplayer is terribly done. Soul Memory is a sh¡t mechanic and you can get invaded whenever so I've been invaded by the same person 4 times in a row and had to physically pull out my ethernet cable in order to get them to stop (they were twinking, so I had no chance whatsoever). There's no way to turn off online mode in-game, instead you have to either go offline mode on Steam, have no internet connection, or pause the network process via the task manager's resource manager. It doesn't help that you have to spend an Effigy to PREVENT being, so it's an opt-out multiplayer instead of opt-in.


There are some things that I think DS2 does good:
Certain animations are really cool, such as the riposte and backstab animations.
Bonfire ascetic and powerstancing are really cool mechanics that I wish they brought back.
It has NG+ content, which makes it feel a bit more unique.
The lore is really cool, with some characters like Vendrick, Raime, and Velstadt being super cool (and one of my personal favourites out of the entire series, Aldia).
Majula is probably one of the best hubs designs, similar to DS1 it's the main hub where a lot of the NPCs gather, but it feels like a really cozy place due to the sunset and music.

Listen, I'm not your typical ""git gud"" f**king nerd; I am a realist with life demands.

Realistically, I can rate this an easy 8.5/10 coming from a ds1/2 completer (I don't do NG+).

(back story below)
Okay, I avoided Dark Souls for many years because people TAG their reviews as ""Dark Souls like""; and to me, the (slightly above average) gamer, it doesn't mean much; UNTIL I played Elden Ring a couple of years ago.  

That play through re-invigorated a desire to discover the source material of ""dark souls"" (and I'm glad I did).  Dark Souls remastered; which is nearly a 10/10 for me, but the predecessor falls short ( like many things ) and only reached 6.5 in my personal opinion.  

Dark Souls III is remarkable; why?! - how can you say that and have NOT beat the game yet?! 

... Well, here's how:

The game rewards you for for accomplishments (big or small); DS 3 is graphically superior; and ( G** almighty the CONTROLS) the interface/controls are spot on.  

Definitely DS 3 is a 8.5/10 only because I haven't finished it myself and I have such short playtime, but from what I read and watched online, I am in for a blissful surprise come the final boss.



My original playtime is approximately 9 hours of not knowing what the f**k is going on, I defeated the first boss and farmed a bit, but that is it,  I am SO looking forward to this.

,148043943,"Replaying the game for the first time in years and wow, I couldn't put it down.

Even after playing Elden Ring, Dark Souls 3 holds up to this day and is one of my favourite games of all time. The Story is a superb conclusion to the trilogy; tying up loose threads and wrapping up story elements from the prior two games. The game play is some of the best of all time with the most astonishing bosses in the series; Twin Princes, Friede, Gael and more are all A+++ bosses. 

The DLCs are incredible, both poignant ruminations on the entire trilogy - the Ringed City in particular is one of my favourite environments in any game world and I applaud FromSoftware for finishing this special series in such immaculate fashion.

,148010229,Neat,True
,148008672,"I should preface this review by stating that I like Dark Souls 3 as a whole. What I dislike about Dark Souls 3 come largely down to story and mechanics, namely the massive system changes that occurred from Dark Souls 1 to Dark Souls 3 (and 2, though to a lesser degree).

To begin with what I like, the level design is a stand-out, as is the art direction and general graphical effects of the game. In comparison to prior games, 3 definitely feels like the most pretty and most like Dark Souls 1 in terms of level design with sprawling maps that always seem to have a way back to your origin point. It is, overall, one of the best games released in its year. 

On what I dislike about the game,

1. Changes to PVP and Health: In Dark Souls 1, you use Humanity at a Bonfire and become Human. This enables both PVP and Co-op in the world, and you can be invaded at random. There is no real mechanical bonus to being Human outside of turning on these mechanics and you can go the entire game without ever becoming Human.
In Dark Souls 2, the whole system is muddied and frankly terrible. There's no distinction between ""Invasion On"" and ""Invasion Off,"" though the game prioritizes Human players to invade based on Soul Memory... It's a mess.
In Dark Souls 3, Embering gives you bonus HP [b]and[/b] turns on PVP. This means that in order to get access to additional HP beyond the amount granted by Vigor, you have to turn on PVP and risk being invaded at random. You are automatically Embered after every boss kill, meaning that you get bonus HP... But also run the risk of invasion. PVP would be okay if lag and other issues weren't present, but being forced into the system by design means that PVP players go up against unsuspecting PVE players and Embering is arguably more detrimental than beneficial, bar the health boost that can help with tackling later game zones. In a word, the whole system is awful and I can see why they abandoned it for Elden Ring.

2. Firelink Shrine. In Dark Souls 1, Firelink Shrine was a sort of hub where you could go to get more uses of your Estus and it was functionally connected to everything. At the same time, you never really had to go back there other than for ease of access to certain zones.
In Dark Souls 3, Firelink Shrine is now a necessity. You have to go there to level up. You have to go there to improve weapons. It's all hidden behind a loading screen, meaning slower systems will have to stare at lore on repeat throughout the entire game. The worst part by far is the repetitive dialogue any time you want to level-up. It was a problem in Dark Souls 2, Bloodborne and a problem here. Elden Ring wisely did away with this system (at least for leveling) and that's a far better system. Dark Souls 1 did it better with the Bonfire level up too. It's a problem that never goes away and just gets more annoying the more you play.

3. Lore: Dark Souls 3 is too focused on being a sequel to Dark Souls 1 (not 2, it references it occasionally, but it borderline ignores it) where it feels that the focus is on the ramifications and results of the original game and not on the lore of the new one. Dark Souls 2 had this problem to what I would argue is a lesser degree, albeit it was a bit too heavy-handed. Dark Souls 3 just name-drops important characters from Dark Souls 1 and copy-and-pastes an area from the first game into the third. This is okay because that area is still cool, but it feels a bit... Tired. I would have preferred something new, something completely distinct from what we got.

It feels like two games. One game is trying to have new lore, new experiences and new things while the other game is trying desperately hard to flash the words ""DARK SOULS 1 IS HERE"" in your face whenever it can.

4. Ignoring Dark Souls 2's Cool Bits: Dark Souls 2 is a divisive entry, and for good reason. However, it had some neat ideas, particularly hyperstancing weapons. This basically meant that, with the right stats, you could wield two weapons of the same type and gain access to a new moveset. Dark Souls 3 cans this entirely and gives you paired weapons. While this does open up the ability to use a stat-improving shield, like the Grass Crest Shield, it removes the unique flavor of hyperstancing entirely. Covenants are also back, but I feel that they're a little bit tacked on and less important this time around. No more Arenas for the Blue Sentinels or the Invaders, no more Covenant of Champions to turn on hard mode. There's also no real rewards for a no-Bonfire run (which is impossible anyway due to the design of the game) or for never dying, both of which Dark Souls 2 had.

Particularly disappointing is that NG+ in Dark Souls 3 does nothing but increase difficulty (and add higher level varaints of rings), whereas Dark Souls 2 revamped zones with new enemy placements new item drops and more. Dark Souls 2 felt like an entire new game in NG+

5. The Bloodborne Effect: This one is a bit more mixed for me. This game clearly has some Bloodborne in it, which is good on one hand because Bloodborne is great. It's bad on another because it feels like they didn't go hard enough on making it Dark Souls and not Bloodborne. The speed of the game is increased, but Shields are back so you can be more passive. Armor doesn't matter as much because of lack of upgrades, and the Poise system being kind of terrible (only activates on swinging some weapons) means that there's less incentive to actually be a big tanky hero like in Dark Souls 1. The lack of a Rally system (damage enemies to replenish recently lost HP) also means that being in close is punished. It's a bit confused as to what it wants to be, in this regard. Workable, as I've beat the game several times, but it feels unrefined. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In closing - Dark Souls 3 is a sequel to Dark Souls 1. It's not bad, but it's not hitting the same highs as Dark Souls 1, Bloodborne or Elden Ring for me. Bear in mind that, with all of the things I dislike, none of the Dark Souls games are truly awful and all of them are incredible purchases, well worth your time. I just so happen to dislike Dark Souls 3 the most of them all. 

Granted, most everyone has already bought this game, so this hardly matters anyway.",False

I think this game could've been better if the devs made it a bit easier. For example when I die to a boss, why respawn me way in the back? making me go through the mob of enemies again getting hit in the process, wasting my estus flasks before the boss fight has even started...you mfs think i must got so much time to go through your un-innovative game, wasting it like that. put a mf'ing bonfire right BEFORE the boss fog gate ffs. also maybe give the player more defense so the enemy can't kill you too fast...or giving the player a slight advantage like more speed/agility, to move faster or attack faster. Or just give the option to play at different difficulty modes like Easy, Normal, Hard. Things like that. 

Though I guess if they made those changes, then it wouldn't really be the Dark Souls game that we all know.. *sighs* just ignore me, I'm rambling lol. sorry to say, but this game ain't great...it ain't that good champ. I don't know why people simp over Dark Souls games so much, but in fact it was so boring i only finished it half-way through, maybe a little more than halfway, last thing I did was i killed pontiff sullyvan, got bored and forgot about the game after that.

I like Sekiro more than DS3. The reason why I don't like DS3 as much as I love DS1, DS2, and Bloodborne is because From Software didn't offer anything new with DS3. They simply grabbed DS1 and DS2, put them in a blender, sprinkled some Bloodborne action in there, and slapped DS3 on the bottle. DS1 and DS2 are worlds apart, and Bloodborne is an entire universe onto itself. I was expecting DS3 to be a whole new thing but it would seem From Software tried to play it safe by giving us their greatest hits album titled Dark Souls 3. But again, if this is your first Souls game that is also good, just don't bother playing DS1 and DS2, and Bloodborne because DS3 is pretty the sampler package. Just move on to Demon Souls, Sekiro, and Elden Ring.",False

,58460083,"Dark Souls 3 is a great introduction to Soulsborne games (At least for me), back in 2019 DS3 popped up on my internet feed I saw a couple of YouTube compilations of players raging at the game but at the same time I was not sure at what I was watching; as someone who was still new at gaming at the time and only started playing FPS I was not sure it was for me. 

I bought the game on special (I think it was 80% off back then lol) , without a Xbox controller I attempted to kill tutorial boss, Gundyr. It was painful on KB&M but I managed after many attempts and luck, it was not satisfying. I quit the game once I got to the first real boss. Fast forward to 2021 I attempted the game again but I cheated (I used WeMod forgive me😞) I finished the game but got banned for using Wemod(whatever it called) I had to delete my save to be un-banned since it was my first & only offence . I deleted my save in shame.

Fast forward to 2023 I'm playing the Lies of P demo on KB&M, the visuals were stunnning and the hype was real I said F**k it im getting a Xbox Controller it time I actually play these soul-like games as intended. The difference was day and night the movement felt natural, the ""mind to controller connection"" felt organic however I was still terrible. Then it clicked I actually need to learn the animation, patterns how to trigger certain enemy movements  to my advantage etc.

I applied what Learned from that demo to DS3 after 4 weeks I finished the base game on my own. Once completed I looked up the lore to find out what I missed from the flavor texts the bug I caught from playing the game grew, I wanted more there is still more to delve in (Still to play:DS1 remastered & maybe DS2, Bloodborne[PC???] ). Blasphemous 1 was my next game in souls-like journey it was a blast a  genre I once thought I would never like I end up loving, It all I play nowadays(currently playing Ringed city at time of writing this review)

Looking forward to DS1, Cuphead, Sekiro mmmmaybe DS2 & soon to be released Lord of Fallen

Great world tho.

",False
,147936995,"I think it has some of a the best bosses period, the fast paced and fluid combat compliments them very much. Another thing that elevates the boss fights is the boss music, there are so many masterpieces within this one game it's actually insane.

As for the areas, which is my favorite part about Souls games (bosses being a close second), most of the areas are very unenjoyable to traverse like Farron Keep, Cathedral of the Deep, & Irrithyl Dungeon for ex. Now the game does have a few areas I LOVED like Irrithyl Valley, Ringed City, High Wall Lothric, & Anor Londo. It was so cool revisiting places like Anor Londo or going down to the Smoldering Lake and seeing Capra Demon and Stray Demon carcasses, I was so happy to see all the callbacks to DS1 and even DS2.

That pretty much sums up my feelings for DS3, I have no problems other than a lot of the areas.

If you liked Elden Ring, this has the most similar combat (albeit with much lower stamina and useless armor). The themes heavily rely on Darskouls 1 so I highly recommend you beat that game before checking this out. Trust me, it's worth it.

,148711701,Master piece,True
,148710929,"Hollow knight is simply amazing. Art, story, visuals, soundtrack and game mechanics are all beautifully done. I play this game on the steam deck, and with a controller this game truly thrives. I love almost everything about this game, from the dialogue to the bossfights and unique characters, but there are some things that I find annoying. One is that it's pretty easy to get stuck at a point in the game where you don't really know where to go or where to get certain abilities you need. The parkour in some areas is a little unforgiving, and I feel like I'm playing Getting Over It sometimes, but besides those things I love this game. Get it. Now. 9.4/10, would recommend.",True
,148710334,"I just finished Hollow Knight, and I can confidently say that it is one of the most special games of all time. I did not expect for me to like this game as much as I did. It is now one of my favorites. Keep in mind that this game was only made by 3 people, and performs many, many triple-A developers. There is a lot to talk about in this game. So let's get started with the review. 

[h1] The Combat [/h1]
- The combat at first is simple, which is good when you are playing a new game. You do not want to be overwhelmed with a ton of combos, and attacks. You get more attack options as you play the game (since it is a metro-vanilla.) There are many different spells, and gear that you get through the game that makes combat more deep. The combat overall is extremely fun, and something that I would come back to. 

[h1] The Enemies [/h1]
- One of the aspects that I would say makes or breaks a combat system is the Enemies. With Hollow Knight, There are 150 different enemies. Of course, there are some similar enemies, but a lot of them are unique, and make you think about how you should encounter them. There are also 46 bosses, that have their gimics. Most bosses in this game, in my opinion, are well-designed, and fun to fight. 

[h1] Lore [/h1]
- The lore is hard to follow, but in my opinion not as hard to follow as other games. My overall lore of this game is very interesting, and I like it

[h1] Is this game a ""Souls-like"" [/h1]
- Yes, and no. This game shares many aspects with the Souls series but also has its unique ideas. Here are some things that are inspired by souls. 

[h2] The World [/h2]
- One thing that is inspired by the series is the open world and navigation. Something that I love about this game is how you are not forced on a linear path. There are many different paths, that you can explore. 

[h2] The Difficulty [/h2]
- I will try not to be cocky here, but on my first play-through ( if you do not count the 3 hardest bosses in the game) I probably died less than 20 times. However, this game is still very hard. The average player will die a lot of times. However, the difficulty does not feel unfair and feels very rewarding when you beat a boss that you are struggling with. 

[h2] Dark Theme [/h2]
- You can tell via the trailers that this game is dark, almost like a medieval game compared to other metrovanilas. However, this does not mean that there are very colorful places, that do not feel like souls. There are many places, such as dark areas. 

[h1] Music [/h1]
- The score for this game is very beautiful, fits the game very well, and sounds amazing. Also, it was made by one guy.

There are many other aspects that I did not talk about. If you want to know if you should get this game. Then 100 percent yes. YES YES YES YES YES. THIS GAME IS WORTH THE PRICE and IS A STEAL WHEN IT IS ON SALE.

First time i downloaded this game was about 3 years ago but i barely played it before uninstalling it and not playing again. About a year later I was bored and decided to give this game another try and my god did I not regret it. The controls are amazing the soundtrack is perfect and the bosses are phenomenal. Your move-set is limited but that is one of the best things about this game. It is a little slow at the beginning but once you get past that you cant stop. This game does not hold your hand so it can get a little difficult to know what to do next.

I've been playing videogames for over 20 years now and I have to say Hollow Knight has probably the best, most satisfying controls I've ever experienced. Moving around the map using the Crystal Heart, Shade Cloak, Monarch Wings and Mantis Claw feels SOOO right, so fluid.

I (at the time of this review) have a 106% complete save file, with hundreds of hours on record. Each of those hours were filled with fun. Download this game. You might struggle at the start, but believe me, it might become one of your favorite games.

Okay, past all the ""emotional biases"", Hollow Knight is amazing, but not perfect. But that barely affects the game. No game is without flaw. My only real gripe with the game is that in some starter areas, they do provide enough hints for needed accessories (ex: the lantern) I personally didn't have trouble with this, but I have noticed that I am MUCH more observant than most.

Other than that, the game is quite frankly a gem in metroid-vainias. The combat, exploration, and rewards all work together to make a beautiful atmosphere. Going back to the combat, it is absolutely gorgeous! One of the most elegant combat systems I've seen, (outmatched by Dead Cells, but that game is almost ALL ABOUT the combat, and hollow knight is much more separated.) All the areas, even if you aren't focused on lore, make sense for the game! The game's art style plays in tandem with the gameplay elegantly.

Okay, lets talk about the music for a second. Two words. HOLY SHIT! This music is beautiful! The motif work is AMAZING, and if you don't have a good reason like I do (listened to every track like twice and like to watch videos while playing,) PLAY. WITH. MUSIC. ON!!!!

Thanks for reading all of this long review, I just had to get my overwhelming love for this game out into the world. Have an amazing day!

[*]The atmosphere, the story, the music, everything about hollow knight makes you want to come back for more.
[*]The difficulty adds challenge, and rewards you when you figure out attack patterns and different badge combinations to help you overcome an obstacle you were stuck on. 
[*]And don't get me started on the game's soundtrack. Every boss fight has so much emotion packed into it with the musical score, it really adds to the experience, and it makes it feel like a true souls game. I could spend hours listening to the OST, from the title screen to the [spoiler] Hollow Knight [/spoiler] fight. 
[*]The world building is also amazing, it feels like you're playing inside of a fully fleshed out world, one which has been struck by tragedy and you are seeing the aftermath. Not to mention almost every major decision you make has an impact on the world around you.

At the time I was so upset about spending almost 90 hours on a playthrough, having a good party comp and (what I believed to be) good relationships with everyone in the party, only to be unable to finish that I just walked away from the whole game and haven't touched it since.  I don't mind difficult combat, or fights that might take a couple of tries to win, but the final fight is literally impossible without a full and balanced party.

Playing an undead? have fun with everyone healing you and you dying so quickly that you end up just not wanting to play an undead character

,147958074,soooo when is the 3rd one coming out,True
,146501367,"[i]Disclaimer:[/i] I played this with the ""Divinity Unleashed"" mod; the only ""gift bag"" I activated was “The Four Relics of Rivellon” (totally recommended, by the way). 

While everybody was talking about ""Baldur's Gate 3"", I came back to finish this spiritual predecessor, left unplayed for over 3 years because I was burned out after going through  [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/heybabyxxx/recommended/373420]the first one[/url] for almost 170 hours.

As a sequel should be, it's bigger (216 hours on my 1st playthrough, without finishing all quests or seeing everything _ I took at least one big shortcut unintentionally) and better than the previous title; many things are familiar, like some spells and skills (and there are a ton of new ones), besides the reappearance of some old characters, like [spoiler]Jahan, Arhu[/spoiler] and [spoiler]Braccus Rex[/spoiler]. You can play this one without experimenting the earlier title, but that's not advised; actually, if you can stomach cRPGs released more than 20 years ago, you may start with ""Divine Divinity""... 

In ""D:OS 2"", there are 6 ""origin characters"" with their own questlines, meaning that the game was meant to be played at least twice: the developers recommend that you create a character from scratch and choose 3 of the origin characters as companions: 2 of them are mages, 2 are melee fighters, 1 is a rogue and 1 is a ranger. I recommend that you create a party of 1 of each of those 4 classes, distributing skills and items and levelling up and positioning them on the battlefiled accordingly. There's also crafting, but you don't really need it _ don't bother picking everything that you find, or your inventory will become a nightmare. Remember: exploration is the main thing here; go everywhere (teleportation is a must!), speak to everyone (even the animals) and search every nook and cranny. Discoveries abound. 

Even though I don't consider this a story-heavy title, the plot is OK. There are [spoiler]3[/spoiler] main endings; I chose the most unusual one and I was pretty happy with the conclusion. Combat is challenging (enemy AI is pretty good), but gets easy by the end, when you reach high levels (I finished at level 20, playing on Normal difficulty, here called ""Classic""); way more difficult are the puzzles (several of them demand trial and error and thinking outside the box). I intend to replay this title one day, on vanilla and with Tactician (Hard) difficulty. 

The most obvious drawback for me is that this one is less co-op inclined than the first; sure you can still play co-op (with other 3 people at the most), but ""D:OS"" had 2 characters as protagonists (who would debate on what to do and dispute who would have the upper hand, even if you played solo), and this has only 1, so you can play solo and not even realize that co-op was a possibility. Still, this is a great game (not a masterpiece, though), totally worth the full price. 

[i]Pro tip[/i]: like the ""XCOM"" series, ""D:OS"" looks and plays better with a controller. If for some reason you never tried to play a cRPG with a controller, give it a shot and enjoy yourself more than you thought it was possible!",True

,147118473,"While DOS2 offers enjoyable moment-to-moment experiences, the slow combat combined with the large and densely packed maps turns what should be a fun game into a slog. The writing, the voice acting, the visuals and combat are all very well designed. But in this case, the whole is less than the sum of its parts, as the micromanagement and memorisation required by all the gameplay mechanics adds up to an overwhelming experience. It's the sort of game where you are best served writing an extensive notes document as you go along, and even then it is very difficult to come back to after taking a break. And it's not like a typical RPG where only completionists need to explore the whole map and complete all the quests; in DOS2, enemies do not scale with your level, the amount of experience and gold available is limited, and being under-levelled makes fights much harder. One final complaint: the dialogue trees are awfully designed. Very often when speaking with an NPC, choosing one option, even as simple as a ""hello"" or ""are you alright"", will needlessly lock off from the other options, sometimes even if they are quest-related. Why on earth Larian did this is beyond me.",False

,117776686,"the game is good
very fun and for those who do multiple playthroughs its really fun to get creative each time

the story started really interesting and different to most games but devolved after the first act
from a race based struggle in a prison where you could proudly stick with and help your own race and you werent pushed to be Bussy friend with everyone finally 
a question of if you would survive and if in what condition and what horrors would the fleshcrafters commit on you,
genuine uneasynes from the flesh moulding experiments,as it should be
the main story and enemy in act 1 while looking obvious were most certainly a cover to a different one,all this mystery and possibilities on where it could go were giving me hints of true wonder and want to know what is going on like in Planescape torment

 (played act 1 long ago so cant describe in detail all aspects and just how much i was wondering and was amazed on how this was well done when i was playing it)

and it went to generic chosen one story where everything that i liked about this new unique story was eliminated and replaced with ""end of the world situation,go and save everything"" and only ocasional mentions to the themes from the first act

i never liked some of the comedy in divinity first sin and didnt like it here,potentialy even more iritating

the dialog is ""generic protagonist"" so nothing worth a mention,nps dialogue had more downs than ups

the final boss was certainly a good suprise

but without the few mods i had (most important was the appearance/transmog change ring which i dont know how i would have played without,dont want to imagine the clown looking gear combinations) it would be a much less enjoyable experience

it is a 7.5/10 game for me,maybe a 8 with more mods,my reviews are much more harsh as a 10 out of 10 game would be near perfection in every field which i dont think any game has managed as just the making of them is subjective and ofcourse they arent made for individuals but for mass apeal,as such i dont think any game can be perfect for a individual,as games either have a good story but ok combat or the opostite,and a hundred other factors that we like or dislike on a moment to moment basis show up

still good  but no where near all the overblown statements said by everyone.

El juego es mas lineal de lo que parece, o al menos lo que yo esperaba, pero creo que es la decisión correcta porque esto hace brillar todos sus apartados. La atención al detalle es magistral, todas las líneas de dialogo con actuación de voz, la cantidad absurda de situaciones emergentes, las distintas rutas narrativas y un sistema de combate muy rico y divertido.

1. Consider a full physical or magic damage party. The game is much easier this way that with a split damage party.

2. Don't be afraid to cheese any fight in the game. There are many ways to win a fight, and the game rewards thinking outside the box.

",True
,147887762,"I recommend this game because it gave me my money's worth, but apart from some aspects of the combat, it is not a game worth remembering.

I got to act 4 the first time I played this game, but I never finished it. Two years later, I couldn't remember much about the game, but having no misgivings about playing it again, I gave it a second try. Again, I got to act 4, and I simply didn't care enough to finish it. Although the combat is fine, the characters feel shallow, and the world is extremely undefined, at least when compared to something like Pillars of Eternity. Every book you open has only a few lines of text, not contributing much lore, and even after a lot of time in game you're asking yourself basic questions like: ""What's the name of this kingdom? Is it a kingdom? What are the names of the neighbouring lands? Is this bishop Alexandar really the top dog, or just some local boss?""
This disconnect is bearable for the first two acts of the game, with the map design and quests being somewhat engaging, but by act 3, you're beginning to feel that you're just running around on an island and doing stuff, not because you want to, but because you have to, just to progress. In act 4, it feels like the designers have been obsessed with making every encounter a ""Haha, gotcha""-moment, which gets old really fast, and both the city, its vendors and its NPC's feel uninteresting.",True

You'll basically read a lot that this game gives you a lot of freedom and that choices matter. They do, but for the wrong reason. You either approach a quest at the right level, and finish it, or approach it at the wrong level (too low) and get slapped. To proceed in the game you will basically have to choose in which order do (almost) all quests. Also those you find boring or useless, or you won't have enough XP to level up and get the next quest done.

So, you can end up grinding and wasting your time with little reward. I'd suggest making levelling up less important for the next game.",False

Ultimately 10/10 deserves GOTY and other devs should really take note of what Larian did with this game and how much the community is praising for them. There are people ASKING for DLC which is the exact opposite to what you see nowadays with other games. Its understandable that studios have to make money but that doesn't mean that they should purposely release 60% of the content to get us hooked and then drip feed us the remaining 40% with DLCs.

,147706793,"It is a nice game which you can play with your friends or by yourself. There are lots of positives for this game: Graphics are pretty good; voice acting, music and sound design is great, world is detailed and pretty big, there are lots to discover with variety of quests which brings a long playtime, lot of skill options to choose from. However, there are some negatives also: The first one would be the Launcher. The one of the most unnecessary things to have. Other than that, there is a problem with the quests. The quest log doesn’t show anything useful, especially with some side quests. Armour set DLC quests are the worst, since it doesn’t give you the place that you can find the next piece and if you have passed the chapter without finding it, that quest line pretty much fucked up. As another point, there is a huge problem with the balance and usable builds. You can build your character however you like but that does not mean that making a geomancer archer viable, since you have to rely on Finesse and Wits. That makes the build options pretty much useless. Most of the time you are granted some attribute and skill points at the level up which is far from being exiting, since you have to go for a certain part. Also, some of the builds are pretty weak, like an archer. These are really important at the hard difficulty, since the most you can do will be fighting an enemy at the same level which is another problem, because the difficulty curve is not balanced at all, especially at the last chapter, one of my characters were one-shotted at beginning of each fight, game forcing some fights with the fixed positions made it even worse. One other thing was the items. Item randomization is a really bad choice for this game. Especially there are intelligence required items which gives skills like huntsman. We had more than 300k at the end game and wasn’t able to purchase anything for a long time also. So, money will be useless after a while. Another problem was main characters’ stories which are a bit short and scattered with a couple quests only. It felt like a feature added as a DLC. Lastly, achievements, decisions, companions and persuasion are not a great mechanics at multiplayer. They are not implemented greatly to the game and it doesn’t feel smooth at all. Still, playing this game is a nice experience overall.",True
,39683342,"This is one of those cases where I really wish there was an in-between score. So why negative in the end?

The game starts out amazing, the first 20 hours of the game are such a pleasure, story is engaging, characters are interesting and the combat is really satisfying. But... as the game progresses, the story slows down to a point where I forgot what was even happening. The combat goes from interesting to just pure frustration. It felt like a chore to boot the game up at a certain point which is when I chose to put it down for good.

The crafting system is the most confusing I've ever experienced and there are no instructions on how to use it. So I ended up just completely ignoring it.

I've restarted the game several times thinking I was missing something (hence the high playtime) but ultimately, it feels to me like they front loaded the game with all the good stuff and didn't care much about the middle/end.

If you've already played the game and are poking around for an opinion (spoiler warning): The game is awesome until you leave the starter island, then it feels like a completely different game, in a bad way. For me at least.",False

,147616221,"I was walking a line between an up/down thumb on this. There's a lot of positives in the game and for me, unfortunately, more negatives.

On the plus, the game looks and runs well, even in 2023. I did not suffer any crashes and load time was acceptable. I played both modded and unmodded, being careful which mods I used since a majority of them will cause you crashes now (got to love how someone puts out a mod and then abandons it). There's a decent amount on content and depending on how much of a speed runner you are, you can definitely get a lot of hours out of the game. For the most part, you can run around about anywhere you want. There's a decent number of quests throughout. Combat is generally enjoyable. The open world is persistent, so all your actions stick around.

On the cons, the questing system drove me nuts. It's a very open world and more often than not, you'll complete one quest that keeps you from either starting another quest or prevents you from completely a completely separate quest. Wondering around and help someone to their grave? You may have inadvertently ended another quest. Decide to go farming some guys for gear and gold? You may have just wiped out the guys you needed for a quest. You are very much punished for exploring without reading every fine print on quests and even ensuring you picked up every possible quest. Since quests are really the only meaningful way of obtaining experience, you can cut yourself off quickly.

Since the world is persistent (no respawns), the world soon feels very void. Your only choice is to push forward. Wanting to practice your skills? There's a target dummy here and there... 

Questing feels a bit like an afterthought, even though its central to advancing in the game. The quest tracking feels like something Minecraft would have where you often have obscure text that doesn't always tell you much of anything. I can understand wanting players to experiment a bit, although with the persistent nature of the game, if you experiment a bit too much, you fail the quest (no do-overs) or end some other quest that was around the same area. Your actions have a few too many consequences. 

Any game that requires you to have some wiki or search engine up constantly should just rethink how they work. Want to craft things? It you like mindlessly trying random combinations in a rather archaic crafting mechanic, you're in luck. Else you are stuck searching wikis and figuring out whether that stick you picked up is worth the effort of combining with a shell. Can't decipher the cryptic text on a quest, back to the wiki. Can't figure out why the tomb won't open, back to the search to find that you shouldn't have off'd that character because that locks the quest out. This had to be the most aggravating part of the game for me. I just don't want to have to think this hard in a game to enjoy myself.

If you love to save every couple minutes and reload saves, you are in luck. If you don't remember to save every couple minutes, it will suck to be you. It's not really that cool to figure out you did something wrong (death, quest or otherwise), think well, I need to go back a bit and find your last save was an hour or more ago. I tried mods with auto save, tried to keep in my head to save often and still would find myself having to roll back or just accept that I'll have to skip content. 

Lastly, this isn't the fault of the game, although I want to throw it out there. I was surprised about how poor the mods are for this game in 2023. Given the age of the game, I would have thought most mods would have settled and there'd be a large selection of stable offerings. What I instead found was most stopped updating in 2018 and somewhere between then and now, they either never worked correctly or stopped working due to game updates. There are some gems out there (couple overhauls were interesting), although you have to be prepared to start all the way over if you find a mod crashes your game or doesn't fit what you want.

I did enjoy a lot of my time in the game. I spent countless hours trying to figure out builds and synergies between powers and of course many, many hours on sites looking at recommended builds because the game is a bit too open on cherry picking your build and absolutely possible to easily build a set of characters that would be lucky to battle crickets. If you enjoy min/maxing, here you go.

I got the game cheap, so I got my $$ out of it. Don't regret the purchase. Felt let down at the end and quit due to frustrations with questing and the void world. Maybe BG3 fits the bill more.",False

,147539111,"Narrator - After finishing the game you are overflowing with emotions. You are reflecting on all you have experienced during your playthrough. Random loot in a game where you cannot grind your gear. 90% of encounters being an ambush. Scripted events lead to infinite knockdown, forcing you to save and reload. Not to mention encounters that would be impossible to get through if it weren't for a character in your party that had the ""right"" spells. You recall a time when you were chopped to death by an out-of-combat entity during an enemy turn. Combat itself was mostly repetitive, favoring an enemy, and highlights on spell boundaries did not reflect the true range. Roleplaying in the game was destroyed by a lack of visual variety for your equipment and character, robot NPCs, and almost all your choices having impact only on the next line of the dialog they were chosen in. Since you played with your friends, it was even worse. Getting through repetitive dialogs or forced exchange of a dialog was common practice. You find it funny that when you got the final and the only impactful choice in the end you couldn't even see your teammates' opinions to further strategise your final decision like you have been doing through the course of the entire game. Last but not least, the main story of the game and basically every dialogue felt extremely generic and shallow. Like they were written by a drama school dropout for an 8-year-old. You cannot but wonder. How can a game with so many shortcomings get an ""Overwhelmingly positive"" rating with 150k reviews? You notice only 11% of players have finished the game on any difficulty and check other reviews. The final question comes to mind. Is Larian's fanbase full of white knights praising its unfinished product and awarding negative reviews with a jester emoji even though it's already six years after release, or is this game beyond your understanding? You may never know.

Cantrip: The lich casts a cantrip.

Paralyzing Touch (Costs 2 Actions): The lich uses its Paralyzing Touch.

Frightening Gaze (Costs 2 Actions): The lich fixes its gaze on one creature it can see within 10 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become frightened for 1 minute. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the lich's gaze for the next 24 hours.

Disrupt Life (Costs 3 Actions): Each non-undead creature within 20 feet of the lich must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw against this magic, taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

,147404042,"TLDR: many many positive aspects that are ruined by improper balancing of multiple aspects of the game. Game is fun through the first 3 acts but act 4 ruins it all.

------------

Great game overall with solid gameplay, voice acting, combat and roleplay elements but it's riddled with balancing issues in many ways : 

->Certain abilities and synergies are just too good to not have equipped. Unless you min-max using a guide, you will more than likely not be optimal and the endgame will be a frustrating experience. And I say that as someone who normally loves to find ways to min-max but, in this game, you have to be sweaty-tryhard min-maxing into pigeon-holed builds. Anything that isn't that will be severely handicapped. If you don't follow a build guide, be ready to spend the majority of the game ""cheesing"" most of the fights by abusing the AI's dumbness (like hiding behind a doorway where AI enemies will rush you 1 by 1). 

->Too many fights near the endgame will have enemies be completely immune (or even heal) from certain elements. As there's only 4 elements in the game, if your team happens to use a lot of spells (like mine with 3/4 of my team being mages) some of your characters will become pretty much useless as their main element deals no damage. 

->Too many cursed elements/surfaces in a lot of fights. Your whole screen will often be completely filled with necrofire or other cursed element. This will cause your own elements to not work more often than not (ie: you want your water mage to fill the field with some water and/or freeze enemies? not possible because the whole f-ing map is filled with necrofire that cannot be extinguished unless you spend your limited source points only for it to become filled with necrofire everywhere once more a round later). 

->Certain semi-generic enemies (mainly voidwoken) will DESTROY you in act 4 with attacks doing 1/4 of your whole hp+armor (even with resistances) while attacking twice per turn and multiple of that enemy type is present in the fight. Have fun chugging through your (limited) resistance potions to just not be oneshot!

->Lots of quests are too hard to complete unless you follow a guide or read the wiki. Too many quests require you to find something or do something and it's really not well explained even if you take the time to read the dialogues and books/notes/clues. 

->Difficulty scaling between the acts is all over the place for combat. Act 1 (mainly the beginning/for new players) can be really hard, act 2 is well balanced overall, same for act 3 but act 4 becomes extremely unpleasant with overtuned enemies and enemies coming at you in far greater numbers than your 4-men party size can handle (unless, again, you're rocking one of them perfectly min-maxed parties or always cheesing). 

->Certain enemies are overleveled to the point where it's impossible to beat them at the ""natural"" level that you happen to encounter them unless you know (in advance) that they are there and you prepared accordingly with a cheesing tactic specifically built for said fight. Those kind of overleveled and overtuned enemies will be evident, when you meet them, that they are literally there to piss you off. Most people will lose to the encounter multiple times until they say ""F that"" and decide to come back later once they overleveled the enemy. That is so badly designed. 

->Lots would come in the game's defence saying ""simply lower the difficulty"". Yes, I can lower the difficulty, but it takes the game from ""too hard"" to ""baby easy"". There's no in-between properly balanced difficulty tier.

,146169683,"Alright, I had to change the review to add in a few more details after 4 hours of gameplay and adding in my original thoughts. 

The game is wonderful, its just a lot of fun. The longer I play in it though there is for sure an element of difficulty that sometimes prides itself on being a type of Dark Souls breed and its usually in the form of bosses as they can be stupidly tough to beat. The level designs are nothing special and you can get absolutely murdered with the wrong build, which this game hinges on. The proper build = easier victories. Not guaranteed, just easier. Its a lot of fun and since there is no ""leveling"" up per say its just progressing the story and trying to get new parts. This adds to the longevity of the game for sure which is a unique element here. The game isnt wanting you to play through long levels that are massive in scale. The levels are specific, short and to the point. This helps with the replayability and swapping out builds to try, this is a brilliant choice in gameplay. It does come with some frustration since some builds can go together like facebook and free speech and others like fromsoftware games go with fun, they either really work or they really dont. 

Edit: Building for bosses is extremely frustrating. You can go into one build through the level and then need something entirely different then the boss. Also, the back and forth of trying to build for a boss trial and error just sucks. Its the one thing that actually does frustrate me very much. 

The game looks pretty good on 4k though the backdrop is bland. It looks more like a game from the late 90's at least in the architecture and such. The story is there to fill in gaps and music isnt really here. 

Overall such a solid experience from FromSoftware. I much prefer this and Sekiro over Elden Ring and Dark Souls, all coming from the same developer, its just a great time. Appreciate the game FromSoftware!!!",True
,148752560,"Clicks in the same way Sekiro did, in that a switch labeled ""Violence"" will flick on in your head.

If you're a Fromsoft aficionado expecting a Soulslike game this is not it, don't come in expecting one. The game is mostly fairly easy by design and plays completely different. There are however some amazing bosses in this, so that part of the Souls DNA is mostly there. 

Also if the game might seem very short, but it's meant to be completed THREE TIMES because there are three endings, with the third playthrough unlocking the chance to get the third elusive ending.",True

Personal Enjoyment Rating - 8/10

Completion time - 38hrs True Ending/16 hours first ending

Suggested for fans of the Armored Core series, general consensus seems very positive. If you like the idea of playing a solo mech and speccing it out with countless weapons and various body parts while managing ‘weight’, ‘power’ and a whole slew of other stats..this game could be for you. It’s a fast paced action packed game with bosses that will stomp you in the ground until you adapt skillfully or quite often...selecting the right build. As a souls vet that’s never played previous AC games, I can safely say I hope to see more sooner than later. 

[h2]Premise[/h2]
Armored Core VI is a long awaited sequel to one of FromSoftware’s earliest franchises. The premise is that you are a mercenary controlling a single mech to complete jobs for the various factions on the planet Rubicon. Being a merc, you aren’t exactly choosing favorites here. It’s a fast paced action packed game with bosses that will stomp you in the ground until you adapt skillfully or quite often...selecting the right build. As a souls vet that’s never played previous AC games, I can safely say I hope to see more sooner than later.
[h2]Graphics[/h2] 
-Looks good, mechs are pretty detailed
-Not much color variety in the environments, could say it looks bleak
-Some of the scale of the environments can be awe-inspiring
[h2]Music/Sound Design[/h2]
-Composed by by Kata Hoshino, alongside Takshi Onodera and Shoi Myazawa 
-Music fits the bleak setting, though nothing much stands out too much for me, doesn’t mean it’s bad
-Lots of Electronic/synthwave
-Mech dash, rocket salvos and some melee weapons sound awesome
[h2]Narrative[/h2] 
-In true FromSoft fashion you are not met with a lot of exposition
-To describe the story I think would spoil the essence of their style of storytelling
-There are very subtle choices in the game, but until NG+ nothing really matters until that final choice.
- Biggest criticism would be that you need to beat the game in NG+2 to get the ‘True Ending’
[h2]Gameplay[/h2]
-High octane prepare for lots of dodging and explosions
-This game is not made to have a single cookie cutter build to blast through the whole game
-Players must get comfortable with switching parts when things get tough, otherwise they will have a bad time
-Bosses can feel unfair at times, again evaluate the build and try something new
-Definitely the most fast paced Fromsoft game I have played
-Mission based, most super short..can finish them within 5 minutes
-You can/should replay missions to get an ‘S’ and ’A’-’F rank. Higher rank reaps higher rewards
-Exploration is super minimal, I can count on one hand how many chests I found with parts in them and they all were very obvious locations on the way to the quest marker
[h2]Performance[/h2]
-Played great on both Steam Deck and Desktop
Thankfully Fromsoft is one japanese company that isn’t forgetting PC performance is important also
[h2]Steam Deck Specific[/h2]
-stable 30fps, medium settings ran and looked good
-I can see text being hard to read for many, it took some adjustment for myself

Only time I wasn't enjoying myself was when i was chasing a flying boss around the arena as he regenerates his pulse shields and hits me with weapons that completely out-range mine. Or they do some BS melee attack that fills your entire screen with color so you can't see which way you're supposed to dodge. Not saying that there shouldn't be these souls-like style bosses, just that some of them are a little annoying to fight.

Oh and hard lock doesn't work with mouse and keyboard because if you even move your mouse  a thousandth of an inch when you go to fire, it will break your hard lock and not track the target, which is infuriating.

Sadly I was not observant enough to notice you could scroll sideways through the parts with 'Q' and 'E' so never got a chance to upgrade the body parts for a longest while, like I got to the boss with the energy shield you have to break first and was PISSED. When I noticed I had unlocked the body parts and they weren't locked behind shit, I felt pretty stupid. The first boss that is used to set your expectations to that level pissed me off too and replaying that mission isn't happening if i can help it as you don't get to make your own machine to seek revenge. Most of the bosses between weren't too bad. THEY ALL got easier once I was able to build my own Machine from head to toe.

I absolutely loved this game, but to be honest it felt kind of lacking in refinement.

I have never died to a normal enemy, and never more than twice to a boss. 

On the other hand, I enjoy trying out different configs, as you can customize basically every aspect of your AC. I've never tried any mech games before this, and I'm impressed with how good everything feels about operating the AC, managing stamina and go for cool plays. It's a blast!

,148643470,"I have never touched AC before this game, so this was my first forte into the game. On the very base level, I had so much fun. The gameplay is addicting and the story is entertaining. I had times where I was having trouble stopping. This game is with flaws though, ill list them out.

1. The story is mediocre when it comes to the writing. From Soft's attempt at making an cohesive story went generally pretty well, compared to their very subdued method of storytelling in the Souls games. That being said, I have qualms. The story seems to be missing.... something. Im not sure what it is, but there is an awful lot that I feel is not told. This is not usually an issue, but in a story where your being far more direct about the games matters it feels like im missing important details. The endings also leave much to be desired. The first two endings left me feeling like I was once again missing something. They were too sudden. The third was much better though in that regard.

2. Gameplay is really fun, but theres some really annoying mechanics. The stun mechanic by far is too unforgiving. The From Soft special on hard games may be a way to justify it (cause yeah this game is genuinely hard), but in multiplayer it is awful. The stun mechanic single handedly created the meta builds for this game. It seriously should be toned down. In a game where movement is focused on heavily, overbearing stun mechanics are infuriating to play against.

3. The gameplay progression is atrocious. The difficulty is all over the place, even regardless of your build. Especially the bosses, you can go from fighting the hardest bosses of the games to some easy throwaway bosses like the difficulty spikes are all over the place.

4. NG (even up to +3) provides very little extra challenge. When your that far into the game and most likely have established builds, I could get through most missions without a single repair kit used, even in NG+2.

5. Special mention towards end of Walter ending, come on From Soft repeating bosses again. They never learn.

i also think it's being sorely underrated for what it is from fromdrone eldenbabies and veteran fans being a bit too harsh imo, but at least with the latter it's understandable, as, again, certain sacrifices were made to achieve the gameplay loop found here. if you're a huge fan of ac1-3 then expect a major shift and go in with the mindset that this isnt quite the same armored core as then, but ac4 and 5 fans will probably enjoy this entry as much as i am aside from the changes i mentioned.

About 22 Missions in have B rank arena unlocked and have to say an alarming amount of people seem to be dogshit at games. Unless there is some massive spike in the game I haven't hit yet,it isn't that hard. Seen some paste eaters complain about ""needing energy weapon for boss.""

And from my limited understanding of AC need different damage types has always been around. The game even lets you mid mission from a checkpoint edit your AC then go back at full HP max heals.  And could everyone STOP bringing up DS and Elden Ring for this game. It's like the concept of dodge the attack and hit the enemy didn't exist to these people before FromSoft made Demon Souls. Being hard and dodging enemies doesn't make this A FUCKING SOULSLIKE! And it's not like anything other then the game being ""hard"" could even get it a Dark Souls tag. Unless you lower the bar to the point that everything is fucking DS. And if so then Crash Bandicoot is the DS of platformers.",True

,148621874,"There is definitely a learning curve with this game. It makes me think of those old action games from the 90s that didn't hold your hand, and if you wanted to beat the whole game you had to do it in one sitting. Some people don't like the mission based format, but to me, this is a breath of fresh air in our ""open-world"" saturated content with a million map markers. I prefer the straightforward nature of this game. It knows what it is, and it does not apologize for it.

It took me about 4 weeks (I have a life) to get past the first few bosses, Balteus and Sea-Spider in particular. I'll admit this was frustrating, but after I became more and more familiar with the game and it's controls, it began to click, and I cannot tell you how satisfying and rare that is in today's games. When you start to get the controls and mechanics of this game it can become impossible to turn off.

I can confidently say that this will be one of the few games in my library that I feel motivated to 100%. This is partly due to the fact that they are all very achievable, and secondly, the fact that there are real game and story beats you are rewarded with for getting that far. Fantastic game. I can't put my controller down.

Oh yeah, I play with a controller. Some people will greatly prefer a keyboard and mouse approach. I prefer the controller (one with grip paddles) so that I can press more weapon buttons without letting go of my movement and aim controls. If you are good with target tracking, you will dominate PvP. I don't care much for multiplayer, I have close to 80 hrs in the game and have yet to play a single match. The single player gameplay is just that good.

Aside from a few lock-ups and crashes (my setup is experimental), the game is wildly stable. I can't stress this enough for an action game like this to be so rock solid.

If you have been looking for a fantastic action game that rewards patience and skill, look no further. Also, the customization abilities given to the player are like a whole 2nd game by themselves. Looking forward to AC7!",True

,148619403,"I can say 17 officially completed the game WITH true ending, and yes 3rd play through. I can say this game surely is difficult and not meant for the week of heart. I truly enjoy my experience with this new gameplay because I been playing armored 1,2,3. The rest i have no chance to.

AC movement - is not as rough and clumsy in the PS1 and PS2 era. The new changes makes it feel like your really into those gundam movement. Last time all the trailer was so attractive but the gameplay makes it too stiff and the melee is really bad with no aim assist. I say its a great change and now evading missile is the least of our problems. Quick melee or large beam projectile will be our worst enemy due to time reaction. Still all this changes are wonderful, the healing i say is good along with the repair points, the olden days, your low HP means no hope of survival and is all OUR own fault.

Gameplay with NON AC units. U will feel powerful like anime Gundam, 1 shot kill & u will feel good about yourself. Dealing with AC is really a nice sensation, some are challenging & some are just number disadvantage (example: 1 on 2, 1 on 3) Still is memorable.

Bosses C-Weapon. Cancerous, there is 1 boss (the spider) took me 5 hours to settle that shit. This is something i admire the game developer, putting something out of the norm to test our skills. There are some truly easy, even acceptable, but there will be also CANCEROUS due to its unimaginable speed & unforgiving melee combo damage!! QAQ

So for those who complaint about the helicopter boss, u guys are not ready because there are worst boss than that. Game refund is an act of mercy already at this point. I complete it & truly feel proud, i will be sure to reply once again because of its replay value.

Replay value, very subtle change for each replay & i love the difficulty difference. This is something not all developer do and this should earn PRAISE rather than focus of ""skins"" or loot boxes. Even by the dialog & mission, subtle changes without making too obvious.

I say u guys deserve many respect to the old Armored Core Fans, even me.

Sea Spider, just go in right under him and he won't hit you much, then use whatever you have equipped with a pile bunker. 3.

The length of the missions is perfect, not too long while retaining difficulty on some missions/fights. The game also encourages multiple playthroughs to allow for different outcomes/missions available depending on your decisions.

The variety of builds you can create from the diversity of the types of weapons and core parts is vast without being too numerous. Seemingly unlimited combinations that can work, depending on your play style.

Armored Core 6 encourages switching up your play style/builds to make missions easier/more fun; which in my opinion, makes a phenomenal mech game. Being that, if you put the effort and time into creating ACs (builds to switch between) instead of being stuck on a boss for days/weeks on end it can be cut down to minutes/hours by switching between the builds and eventually finding a weakness for the boss/stage you're on.

Having now 100%'d Armored Core VI's content, I can say with confidence that this has been one of the best games I have played that was released this year. While its mission-based gameplay can cause hiccups in story pacing, the ability to design and pilot a mech- sorry, AC, based on my own preferences was an absolute blast. Fine-tuning your AC for whatever the game can throw your way is fun in initial playthroughs, and optimising for S-ranks is equal parts frustrating and rewarding.

I've heard from some that the story feels lacklustre, to which I disagree. In your face stories have never really been Fromsoft's style from what I'm told, so having lore take a backseat to the action while permitting the dedicated sleuths to discover more of the setting through exploration and repeat playthroughs felt just fine. Just because there isn't a steam achievement for finding all the data logs doesn't make it any less rewarding to get those tidbits of info.

Apparently the complaints of a few outweigh the many. Boss battles have been changed/made easier, weapons have been debuffed and/or buffed for multiplayer sake... the normal spill by this point, with anything released in recent years, sadly.

A go to strategy, part choice, or tactics WILL change and/or become obsolete depending on how people complain and demand change. So keep that in mind.",True
,148529935,"Whew. That took a while. I completed all the missions. Got all the endings. Got all the upgrades. It's been a while since a game got me this hooked.

Here's what you should expect:
* This is not Dark Souls.
* This is a fast-paced mech game. The game's much faster than the likes of Mechwarrior, think more Gundam, but the mechs are more like fighter jets or tanks.
* There's a ton of customization: a decent amount of body parts, a very broad arsenal of weapons, incredible flexibility in terms of paint palettes and decals. It's not as open-ended as the previous 3 games, though - no weight-balancing to ensure your mech can turn fast in all directions.
* Not all mechs will be right for all missions. In the end I found the one that matched my playstyle and mostly stuck to it, but some missions need custom builds or benefit a lot from them.
* There's tons of replayability. You can replay any mission you've already beat. When you beat the game, you start from the beginning with all your unlocks, ready to try the missions you skipped last time. In fact, you need to do this at least three times to unlock everything.
* There's PvP - 1v1 or 3v3. Seems fun, not my thing.

Some tips:
* You *need* to learn to customize your mechs. If you use the same build for every mission you're going to have a bad time. It's a little daunting at first, with all the numbers to each part... but they're very well explained. You'll learn what to care about. Look for Crightt's videos on YouTube, he does a great job explaining how parts work and what to pick.
* Don't grind, you don't really need it. Sell the parts you're not using, you'll get all your money back every time.
* Explore, try new approaches. Give Iguana a bad time.

However, as you gain experience and grow accustomed to the game's unique mechanics, subsequent playthroughs tend to become considerably more manageable. In my case, after completing my first playthrough with the Immortal Severance ending, my second run with the Purification ending felt notably easier. Additionally, taking on all the gauntlets of strength contributed to this enhanced sense of control and mastery.

In essence, Sekiro's progression encourages players to ""get good"" by developing their skills and adapting to its intricacies. It's a game where, once you've refined your abilities, the difficulty curve becomes more satisfying, transforming the once seemingly insurmountable challenge into a rewarding experience.",True

I began my fromsoft journey with Elden Ring, then played Bloodborne, and have now moved onto Sekiro. While Sekiro does not match the experience I had with Elden Ring, I do think that the gameplay overall is better. The Sekiro gameplay is almost perfect. It feels too good, after doing well on a boss, becaus the gamplay is incredible. I cannot recommend this game more than Elden Ring, but it is sooooo good.

I just finished my first blind playthrough at 25 hours. This game is really close to knocking Elden Ring out of my #1 spot. The combat flows incredibly well and rewards aggression. The process of mastering each boss fight was fair and most of all, fun. There really isn't any souls-like that even comes close in terms of combat mastery.

Funnily enough, I played Lies of P before playing Sekiro and I think that made me appreciate the parry system in Sekiro much more. LoP was great but I had a lot of gripes with their parrying system.

I agree with the general consensus that the game is probably the most difficult title FromSoft has put out. But as long as you're emotionally stable, learn from your mistakes and know how to read, you'll be fine. If Asmongold can beat this game, so can you. Don't give up!",True

,49954179,"I want you to know I mean this with all sincerity, Sekiro is a bad game.
They put an incredible amount of effort into making a bad game, it's poorly built and leaves it to you to make up for its shortcomings by persistence, and by all accounts this is done intentionally.
It presents you with a new and complex combat system and does everything it can to make learning that combat system as lengthy and laborious as possible. Ridiculous damage levels, unbalanced overworld encounters, lazy ganks/crowd positioning, unintuitive progression paths, narrow combat options, detrimental and/or misleading visual cues, absurdly restrictive recovery options and the persistent Fromsoft refusal to provide you with even the cursory knowledge necessary to engage with their games, it's just tedium on tedium on tedium. The amount of time this game insists you waste, for no other reason than it says so is staggering. This was never an issue of git gud, this is an issue of how little space you're given to git gud and why in the fucking world you would ever want to. Adding a 5 minute timer to every death in dark souls would make beating a boss take longer as well, what value does that add though? The run to the boss again didn't add anything but tedium, and it feels like that sensation of having to run your ass back over and over permeates almost the entire entity of sekiro. The stealth is mediocre but when I have to redo a stealth section each time I want to give a mini-boss another try before he deletes me in one 2 hit combo that required me to already know what his tell meant ahead of time, with a warning sign that could mean 3 different things and blocks your vision of the animations, while I'm equipped with a healthbar and a half's worth of healing I'll never get to use, suddenly the stealth feels a lot worse, and so does the gank squad he'll spawn with, or the sniper on the roof I have to deal with beforehand every time, should I be so lucky that there's only one. The game also has an obsession with excess healthbars and most minibosses hit harder than the bosses proper which just feels like the overworld design team and the boss design team were too busy gangstalking schizos on their lunchbreaks to communicate to each other whether you're supposed to be 1shot by everything in the game or just 76% of everything. This game is bad until you master the combat, and it makes sure mastering it is as slow, laborious, tedious, dull, miserable and painful an experience as possible. I wanted to beat this game just so I could say I still hate it for what it is and what it represents, but I honestly don't think I can force myself to do it, I've spent weeks of my life scrubbing rust off the bottom of trucks in the middle of winter with a wonky drill attachment that would fly off every 10 minutes fall down next to my head and take off down the road (which I'd have to go get only to repeat the cycle) and that feels like a fond memory in comparison. The fact that I paid for this, and an entire 60 god damn dollars is insane, and the only thing more insane would be continuing to play it when it gives me whatever the exact chemical opposite of dopamine is, solely to convince people on the internet my opinion is valid when they already made up their own damn minds. Call me what you like, and if you got something out of this game I envy you, but that changes nothing for me, this game was the worst piece of media I ever spent money on and it's not even close. It's so bad it somehow bled into elden ring and made that an unlikable experience too, which I didn't even risk buying myself since I was made aware by this game that From software has concluded its balancing efforts and decided they don't make games anymore, just money. That perhaps is the only compliment I can give it, it was the red flag to signal me to never give From a cent again. I'm better off paying for CBT sessions, same experience except I actually get to feel the touch of a woman for once, which for the fellow soulsborne enthusiasts out there, is a truly novel experience.

TL;DR Game's shit unless you fetishize suffering like those dudes that do no hit runs of entire games or even franchises, them I can understand liking this. To the rest I would say your time and money are better spent learning to whittle or bake, perhaps even touching grass.",False

,148565578,"Most enjoyable combat I've experienced in any game. Incredibly good story, beautiful scenery and stunning detail.",True
,148562642,"Game's crap, utterly overrated. Here are my points.
For context, I tried to endure through this game and gave up on it 4 times completing only one boss,
on the fifth try i finally could make it, got through all of the bosses in 5 or less attempts with the demon bell enabled except Corrupted Monk which took 10~ tries and Isshin the Sword Saint where i had to turn off demon bell in 20~ attempts.
1. Gameplay.
People say it's fun and it's a rhythm game, i can agree on the rhythm part except it's without music and completely relies on combo memorization, play osu!mania without music and just memorize the combination to complete the map, not very fun.
And when you get hit it's usually 50% and up to 80% of your hp, which decimates your posture which forces you to sprint from the boss to heal and start building up his posture all over again. Sure when you memorized all attacks it looks and plays fun, pity thats like 2% of total gametime. If you don't wanna die and game highly incentivizes you to try to hang on to your life by taking half of your current skill point progress and half of your money WITH NO MEANS TO RETURN THEM and occasionally inflicts Dragonrot which is completely unnecessary and useless mechanic when you can literally cure it for 200~ sen, it's just annoying hassle, sure it's not impactful and i had to only cure it once, but why have it in the first place?
So if you don't wanna die you try to play most efficiently, right? The problem is the most efficient tactic is to cheese the fuck out of the enemies, for example, early in the game you encounter chained ogre, most of people had troubles dealing with him initially myself included, and what's the most efficient tactic to beat him? You kill the guards, aggroe him, go away far enough and deal a stealth blow, half of the work done, but if you die and do all the steps all over again repeteadely, this gets annoying really fast, you basically have to do 30-60 seconds of prepwork each time before an actual attempt and it happens too frequently in this game, Long-arm centipede Sen-un, where you have to kill 5 smaller centipedes each time while boss is also trying to kill you while youre at that, and not dealing with them isn't an option either, gank fights are nearly impossible in this game, runbacks to mini-bosses who are frequenly harder than the actual bosses are terrible in this game. In boss fights you also are incentivized to cheese them, you find one or two moves where you can deal damage, do so a couple of times so their posture breaks at an adequate pace and do this process 2 or 3 three times, depending on the boss, alternalively you bash your head against the wall 10 or 20 times so you perfectly guard his every move, i can't find this fun. Also you only get one weapon and most fights are 1-2 attacks, deflect, 1-2 attacks, deflect, 1-2 attacks, boss makes his ""black-flame-360 degree-way of the phanthom dragon-mortal strike"" move while you jump on his head, deal 2 attacks and all over again.
I don't understand the praise for the Isshin the Sword Saint fight, boss has 4 healthbars and 3.5 movesets, this is just toxic difficulty, basically your prepwork is first two healthbars which ideally last 60 to 90 seconds and then difficulty spikes rapidly, you just try to memorize the moves little by little every death, how is this any fun? Spending minute and a half to get to the actual boss is bad design, real difficulty is your mental state, i felt exausted at the end of the fight, i didn't feel like i've beat the odds and overcome the challenge like i did when i beat Malenia (no spirits, no freezing pots, two-handed Nagakiba, 120~ lvl, if you assume i didn't fight ""the right way"" or that im a casual, i would argue not). Okay enough of the gameplay, i already wrote too much.
2. The World
Sure the world looks beautiful, but i got kinda bored of it and sometimes lost (namely in Ashina Castle) because of the repeating architecture, i feel like there could be more variance, subjective, not a big flaw.
The enemy placement, it's bad, like, you place 5 F***ing okami warriors in the same place? How are you supposed to fight them? I wrote about gankfights earlier, i don't think i could take 2 in a fight, and you place 5? Theres also a moment in foutainhead palace where you encounter 2 nobles and a lightning naginata okami warrior in a wide corridor and no means to run through them or get around them, the problem is this warrior doesn't chase you in a safe place from nobles and one of the nobles is behind a fence which makes it impossible to kill him from a distance, it makes the encounter very annoying and painful. Or the s**tton of Fencers in ashina castle, difficulty just for the sake of it, basically you have to cheese again or just run through them which i started to do at some point, there's just no reason to fight common enemies, considering the effort and reward.
3. Customisation
You get NO cosmetics for your character and your only weapon, until you completed the game and beat gauntlets,
even Lies of P, which gets too much hate i feel, has some limited customization and it's enough to freshen things up.
It's not a major flaw of course but i got a little tired in the end, you don't get the feel of progression, you're the same ragged shinobi as you were at the start of the game.
4. Movement
It feels slippery and i felt like i couldn't rely on it, especially catching ledges and inintuitive seemingly random grapples.

,148528296,"as of writing this review i have completed the game on one of its endings and am at 52hrs
this game is great. if your looking to pick it up and have some concerns please read my 2 cents:

its not a game where you can immediately go for long hours on, pacing yourself and giving yourself time to rest before taking on the challenge again is a good start to training yourself slowly  on the combat. (untill you get better) 

its also a game i highly recommend searching on how to play,
 basically there are two ways of killing the enemy
deflecting there attacks so there posture bar fills up which will lead to a deathblow winning the fight, 
or deplete  the health which will give you a chance to deathblow allowing you to win the fight, BUT its like a dance with each battle having there own flow, if you just defend then your posture might break

if you just attack you will die because the enemy hit hard no matter what,
learning the flow really helps with the battles its how the game was made to be played.
so if you do pick the game up please take what i have said into considerations, and if you do you will find a masterpiece of a game, one with a great story and game-play.

i did download this mod to just give me some quality life improvements mostly just borderless window and fps unlocker because it dose run on 60fps and i WANTED MORE hehe, also the auto collect cause im lazy
hears  the link in case you want to do the same: https://www.nexusmods.com/sekiro/mods/13

i also found looking up ways to defeat the character was really helpful,

like i said before its like a flow
spamming will give you troubles
and blocking aswell
slowing  the pace and learning what the enemy dose will help you get there quicker, anyway 
peace and love

,148468895,"This game is a work of art from a game design perspective.

While the combat may be a bit confusing at first to those who have played the other Souls titles, stick with it. Once you figure it out, it becomes easily the most enjoyable of the entire series in my opinion. It is lightning fast and smooth as butter. Instead of constantly staring at your opponent to wait for your chance to dodge and get a few hits in, the game actively rewards you for being the aggressor and attempting to break your opponent's posture before the same is done to you.

I will say, this game is even more reliant on raw reaction time than the other titles. If you are not snappy with reactions or good at learning boss attack patterns, you will struggle with this one, at least to start.

However, it is definitely worth sticking through this one. Once the combat finally clicked for me, I had the most fun I have ever had with a melee combat game. This game has perfected the art of making you feel like  an absolute badass, and you deserve it, too.

As far as the negatives go, there aren't too many. I do wish the game wasn't locked to 60 FPS, but we've all come to expect that from FromSoft PC releases. If you don't go out of your way to beat minibosses and acquire items and upgrades, some fights can be an absolute slog, but they are very few and far between.

Overall, an easy recommendation to any that enjoy the genre. Give it some time to click for you, you won't regret it.

CS2 should've been either delayed and get more fleshed out before release (at least to feature parity) or be its separate thing, not completely replacing csgo.

Now on the ethical side:
Removing CSGO entirely from the library (Which in my case was a game I actually bought for 15 euros on release) and keeping it's stelar reviews for CS2, many of which no longer aply, I find it very shady. I bet if EA had done that they d had hit the headlines as the most hated company.

The game constantly crashes at random times, then they give me competitive cooldown, curtently i'm at 24 hours cooldown because of crashing.
A LOT of cheaters can be found in matches, also smurfs who just wants to ruin every player's fun possible.

The enemies aren't fun to fight against. I cannot comprehend the way they move and attack. There are no wind-ups for most of them and the devs use the exclamation mark as indication. I don't wish to condemn their capabilities but relying on an ""!"" leads me to believe they know the issue as well. 

Seeing a tiny ""!"" in a room filled with many types of enemies, with the explosion of colors and particles the game showers the screen with just doesn't feel fun. 

Another issue I have is there are no ""items"". Almost all games in the genre have items that modify many aspects of a run but in this one, it is only ever gear. Weapons and tools. No items. There is nothing to look forward to in a run. you got a nice weapon? You won't be looking at anything else.

Of a rogue who's not quite what you're told.
""Dead Cells"" they call it, a curious delight,
A pixelated world where you'll die, take flight.

With every demise, a lesson you'll learn,
As your character's fate takes another sharp turn.
You'll hack and you'll slash, you'll dodge and you'll roll,
In this procedurally generated deathly stroll.

The enemies swarm, like bees to a hive,
But you'll laugh as you slay, feeling oh so alive.
A whip, a bow, a sword, or a shield,
Choose your weapons wisely, the power to wield.

The humor is dark, the visuals so bold,
A mix of the grotesque and the comically cold.
The graphics are stunning, pixel art grand,
In this ever-changing world, you'll make your last stand.

The soundtrack, it thumps, like a heart in your chest,
As you fight through the levels, never knowing what's best.
The boss battles loom, challenging and grand,
With patterns to learn, as you face the next brand.

So if you seek laughter in the face of your doom,
""Dead Cells"" is your game, in pixelated costume.
It's quirky, it's tough, a true rogue-like surprise,
With humor and action, under death's watchful eyes.

So here's to the cells, both living and dead,
In this game, they've been masterfully wed.

""Dead Cells"" is a gem, worth many applause!",True

Modern buzzwords aside, Dead Cells is an action platformer with procedural levels that grant you infinite replayability. It's one of the best platformers with the smoothest movement, the most epic combat and some of the most beautiful 2D pixel graphics out there. It's refreshing to see a developer try and innovate on oldschool visuals like this, just shows how far we've come. This game has also taken huge inspiration from classic games and learned all the lessons of the days of yore, taking this knowledge and combining it with modern technology and experiences to create something classic but polished and approachable. It's like the ideas of classic action platformers finally realized to perfection. 

Dead Cells can be brutally difficult, but considering how fluid the amazing combat is and how crisp the controls are, it's a pure test of skill. If it gets too intense, don't forget to just stop for a bit to take in the beautiful art and amazing music. Hell, I wasn't really a fan of Metroidvanias, Souls-like games or 2D platformers in general going into this, but this game is so good, I loved it anyway and it changed my mind on all of those. I feel like with this experience, I might try and conquer an actual Souls game now, and maybe a Hollow Knight or Shovel Knight on the side. Until then, I will always know that I have one of the best roguelikes on the market to fall back on.

P.S. After you inevitably get seriously invested and then seriously addicted to this game, research the lore!

,148861218,"Elden Ring... the game we've all been waiting for, the unicorn of the gaming world, a collaboration between the brilliant minds of George R. R. Martin and FromSoftware. But if you're expecting a peaceful stroll through a fantasy meadow, think again. Elden Ring is like a never-ending game of ""Whack-a-Mole,"" except the moles are massive, nightmarish creatures, and you're armed with a rusty butter knife.

The story is about as clear as a muddy pond, which is just how we like it, right? You're a Tarnished, an outcast from a mysterious realm, and your job is to explore the Lands Between, uncover secrets, and battle epic foes. Good luck deciphering what any of that means because, frankly, I'm not entirely sure either.

Now, Elden Ring boasts a beautiful open world, but don't let that fool you. The moment you step outside, you'll be swarmed by grotesque monsters who seem to be on a strict diet of adrenaline and caffeine. You'll die. A lot. But that's okay because death is just a minor inconvenience in this grim and perilous land.

The bosses, well, they're the real stars of the show. They're like the mean older siblings of the Dark Souls bosses, and they have an ego the size of a dragon's horde. You'll scream, cry, and maybe even throw your controller a few times, but when you finally conquer one of these monstrosities, you'll feel like an absolute legend. Until you meet the next one, that is.

Speaking of legends, the horse riding in Elden Ring is nothing short of legendary. You'll gallop through forests, fields, and the occasional pit of despair while trying to make your mount understand that ""straight"" means going forward, not sideways. But hey, it's all part of the fun.

Now, the game's lore is so deep that it's practically a bottomless well. You'll meet characters with names like ""Lady Marika the Ashen"" and ""Swordmaster Oleg the Desolate,"" and you'll forget who's who within five minutes. But you'll nod along and pretend to understand because the game's atmosphere is so immersive that you'll feel like you're in a Game of Thrones episode.

In a nutshell, Elden Ring is a masterpiece that's as challenging as it is mystifying. It's a game that takes you on an epic, punishing journey, and when you reach the end, you'll feel a mix of exhaustion and exhilaration. It's the kind of experience that will leave you pondering the meaning of life, or at least the meaning of ""you died"" on your screen. So, dear Tarnished, sharpen your rusty butter knife and prepare for a wild, mind-bending ride through the mystical and perilous Lands Between. Good luck. You're going to need it.",True

,111237933,"Final verdict: 7/10

Before going through what I think of the game, I want to clear the air about how you should look at this game going in. It is NOT Sekiro or Bloodborne so don't play like you did with those games. Put most of your effort towards grinding souls (runes) and exploring to handle mainline bosses. If you really are having a tough time at the game, just do a mage build and reek havoc. 

I love the art style and how filled the open world is, which makes for nearly endless content. The story is pretty good, though it treads the same story beats as a souls game. Combat is that of dark souls but now fully polished for better game feel. Bosses are cool and interesting until the game starts reusing them. Its the best SOULS-LIKE game from software has ever made and great for anyone new getting into the series. Even though its far from perfect, It's one of the best games to come out in recent years.

I do have problems with the game that I don’t think make it a masterpiece in my book. It’s a amazing game and everyone should at least try it, though to say it’s the best game from software has made is just not true. My bias lies on the fact I love sekiro and bloodborne, which I believe are masterpieces in their own rights. The following is a list of problems I have with the game: 
-frame rate issues
-delayed inputs
-game tabs out 
-when torrent (the horse) dies in battle, to summon him again you have to answer a yes or no prompt which is stupid and distracting.
-some enemy AoE animations dont match to hitboxes (it radiates in waves, which makes sense, though some animations don't tell that to the player)
-dungeons are boring and uninspired 
-slow rolling in general 
-too heavy of an emphasis on exploring rather than narrative progression (personal opinion)
-too many repeat boss fights

There’s more personal opinions that I think don’t make it a masterpiece that some others may over look or not worry about. It’s a very long game and you are not going to finish it over a weekend. I do really like this game and it’s super rewarding at times, though I cant help but feel I’ve played better.",True

,122032112,"Downgrade from Dark Souls 3 with both PvE and PvP aspects let us wait for DLC's to fix this bare bones of a game

Here's my list of complaints of this game(will change with DLC's):

-Broken late-game areas and bosses
-No covenants, no mad spirits
-Gankers paradise invasion pvp with mostly 3 versus 1 invader
-Garbage looking late-game armor (Bull-goats set for example)
-Broken ash of wars(Moonveil's Transient Moonlight, Rivers of Blood's Corpse Piler...)
-Copy-paste catacombs(with fairly trash rewards), mobs and mini-bosses
-Broken dual wielding(dual straight swords, dual curved swords, dual spears...)
-Many chainsaw glitchers that ruins everyones experience with the game(instantly killing everything)
-Broken build-ups(Blood Loss, Sleep, Madness)
-Cheaters despite the easy anti-cheat garbage
-Colesseum's that turned out to be a garbage because of many broken builds that insta-kills you or just make your experience insanely annoying (currently only 1v1 duels are alive)
-No punishment for those who alt+f4 from the game once they realize they're losing a pvp fight

I wish they focus more on fixing elden ring rather than other stuff like armored core series that has rather smaller fan-base / player count. If you can't balance the pvp in this game then why not create a seperate title for it? Elden Ring Online for example? That would set the potential of pvp much higher without taking toll on pve experience. I have nothing against fromsoftware as it is still one of the best game developers of this era but they honestly stop caring about their games once it is released and they deal with pvp aspect of their games rather poorly.",False
,148838107,"beat it level 1, malenia took 300 tries and yes I did enjoy it",True
,143963034,"It took me 30hrs of playing to actually understand why Elden Ring is so good. I come from never playing any FromSoftware games, so it took me a while before I got a handle of the combat mechanics and overall pacing. The time spent discovering various mechanics for the first time has been insanely rewarding. The combat is very enjoyable, which is the reason why I feel so engaged while playing Elden Ring. Magic, sword parrying, backstabs are all awesome mechanics that I love so much. 

I definitely think this game has a horrible system for discovering the uses of items in the game- as well as how to proceed through quests. I find myself having to google guides on how to find locations in the map, complete quests and find key items that would help my character's build be stronger. This would be fine if you've played through a game several times, but I still am on my first playthrough, and find it annoying that I have to alt-tab out of the game constantly which leaves me unimmersed. My other critique would be that the game is simply too depressing at times. There are many moments of death, decay, blood and rot, infected humans, and war. This has caused me to feel hopeless and sad at times-- which I can understand the point and connection these themes have with the lore, but to me it can be a little much at times and forces me to sigh and take a break from the game. But hey, it is sometimes funny getting one-shotted by a mechanized iron maiden that kills you but engulfing you with its festering tentacle arms. 

In my honest opinion, this game is a waste of money if you don't have 30+ hours to spare and don't mind the chores that come with finding items and completing quests. You also need to be fully ready to embrace the lore and challenging gameplay system that the developers have created.

This is beautiful and intriguing and epic and exhilarating and none of those things are a drop in the bucket next to the sheer irritation of effectively being told, ""Learn this boss this way or you can't move on,"" 165 times.  I happily ignored that, slapped on an easy-mode mod, and played something that was at least an approximation of a game I could enjoy, because the base version of Elden Ring is, well, not that.

Where did this company go wrong?  I think it was nearly right away.  Demon's Souls, for instance, can be a fairly broken game once you learn how the leveling system can be turned to your advantage, and I found it rather fun to hammer almost every boss in the game with magic.  The runbacks didn't bother me (because hardly anything killed me anyway), maybe only one zone felt unfair due to stairs (looking at you, Ritual Path), but I feel like they were onto something that they promptly ignored.  Yes, you can likely break Demon's Souls harder than just about every other game of theirs, but that's what worked for me: knowing the bosses were unfair, and that I could be just as unfair as them.

I would love the Elden ring with the mechanic and easy to understand collectable system from god of war.


Merging the intricate and rewarding gameplay mechanics of Elden Ring with the more intuitive and user-friendly collectible system from God of War could indeed create an engaging gaming experience. This fusion could potentially offer the best of both worlds: the challenging and expansive gameplay of Elden Ring, paired with a more accessible and straightforward approach to collectibles and progression from God of War. Such a hybrid could cater to a broader spectrum of players, retaining the depth and complexity that seasoned gamers seek while providing clearer guidance and a less steep learning curve for newcomers or those who prefer a more direct gameplay experience.

That would be a great expention of the game that I would buy 

Absolutely, such an expansion could enhance the accessibility and user-friendliness of Elden Ring while retaining its core gameplay mechanics that many players enjoy. By simplifying the collectible system and providing clearer guidance on item usage, akin to what is seen in God of War, more players might find it easier to immerse themselves in the rich and challenging world of Elden Ring. Moreover, this could potentially attract a wider audience to the game, including those who might have been initially deterred by its steep learning curve and complex item systems. This scenario illustrates how developers can draw inspiration from different titles to refine and expand upon their own game's design to cater to a broader or different audience segment.",True

• Elden Ring offers a breathtaking open-world experience that constantly surprises and rewards curiosity.

• The organic side stories, rather than the grand overarching plot, keep players enthralled with characters' unique agendas and goals.

• Freedom is the cornerstone of Elden Ring's design, allowing players to explore the vast world at their own pace.

• Legacy Dungeons provide a blend of wide-linear levels and challenging encounters, reminiscent of Dark Souls.

• The combat system introduces new elements like guard counters and jump attacks, adding depth and variety.

• Enemy design and variety, coupled with impressive boss battles, contribute to a challenging yet satisfying gameplay experience.

,135150738,"AI GENERATED: Once upon a time, in the tropical paradise of Banana Island, there lived a charismatic banana named Benny. Benny was no ordinary banana. He possessed a unique charm and a zest for adventure that set him apart from the other bananas on the island.

One sunny day, as Benny was hanging from his favorite banana tree, he noticed a beautiful pineapple named Penelope. Penelope was the most exquisite fruit Benny had ever seen, with her vibrant golden color and spiky green crown. Instantly, Benny felt an inexplicable attraction towards her.

Determined to win Penelope's heart, Benny swung into action. He devised a plan to impress her with his talents. Benny knew he had to showcase something extraordinary, something that would make Penelope notice him amidst the sea of other fruits on the island.

With the help of his banana friends, Benny organized a grand talent show. Fruits from all over the island gathered to witness the spectacle. Benny, dressed in a dashing tuxedo, took to the stage with his yellow peel shining brightly under the spotlight.

He began juggling, effortlessly tossing fruits into the air, creating a mesmerizing display of agility. The audience cheered in awe as Benny's juggling act reached its climax. But Benny had a surprise up his sleeve. With a swift motion, he juggled Penelope herself, spinning her delicately in the air. The crowd gasped in amazement, and Penelope couldn't help but be impressed by Benny's audacious display of skill and devotion.

As the talent show concluded, Benny approached Penelope with a bashful smile. ""Penelope, you are the sweetest fruit in all the land. Will you be my pineapple, and allow me to be your banana?"" he asked, his voice filled with hope.

Penelope blushed, her pineapple cheeks turning a shade of rosy pink. ""Benny, your talent and courage have won my heart. I would be delighted to be your pineapple,"" she replied, her voice filled with affection.

From that day forward, Benny and Penelope became inseparable. They went on countless adventures together, exploring the hidden wonders of Banana Island and creating memories that would last a lifetime. Their love story became the stuff of legends, and the fruits of Banana Island admired and aspired to find a love as extraordinary as Benny and Penelope's.

And so, in the land of ripe fruits and tropical dreams, Benny the banana and Penelope the pineapple lived happily ever after, their love shining brighter than the sun that bathed their island home.",True

This is the best souls game ever, and very possible game of the decade.

It has some performance problems, it sometimes freezes for a split second while loading what i presume is something new.

But this does not take away from the amazing experience that this game is.
Its big, beautiful and full of places to explore.
The biggest  problem is with the size, its ginormous, and the reality is running around is one of the weaker aspects of the game, while being inside castles and caves is the fun part.
The addition of a horse does not really help the game, it makes exploring less dangerous so the game becomes exponentially easier and you are less likely to experience the areas if you can just sprint through them.
Its also the easiest souls game ever, so i guess journalists finally got their wish.
While you can respond with ""Just dont level so much"", what, you want me to intentionally suck?

,148774434,"I'm enjoying it. There's a lot of bloat though. I mean a LOT. So many consumables to be collected that you'll never use. Like dozens upon dozens of them. So many recipe books to find and collect to make said useless consumables. Materials to make those consumables. ""Bells"" (shop unlocks) to collect so you can buy those materials instead of running out and farming them. In order to make the world as big as they did here, they basically had to add a bunch of junk that you'll never use. The more you play, the more you realize the best move is to just skip everything and run straight through to the boss or next checkpoint.

As well, From Software games are known as ""difficult"". Fair but tough. This one, I dare say, tips the scales into the ""cheap"" category more often than not. One of the problems, as I see it, is that there's a contingent of the player base for which nothing is hard enough. They're out making YouTube videos beating their games in 11 minutes without getting hit and using nothing but their fists. Or something like that. And then gaming media covers that stuff. So, From keeps upping the difficulty - I mean you can't be known as the ""difficulty"" game company if everyone is trivializing your content! Here in Elden Ring, that translates to enemies having just overwhelming, over the top aggression. Claw-tail swipe-jump up drop the hammer of doom-breath weapon of insta death covering the entire battlefield. Repeat. No break. Ever. You need a certain amount of armor just so you can drink a potion and tank through the inevitable hit you're going to take while drinking it. Previous games were a lot more thoughtful in the combat, but here it's pretty telling when you go to YouTube and look at Elden Ring builds and every one of them has ""Overpowered"" or ""Broken"" in the title in order to goose the algorithm. The game often feels so cheap, that the player feels justified in putting together an equally cheese build. Things like shields, carefully checking your surroundings...feels like a mugs game here. Just go two handed and put together some cheese build that deletes a boss in one or two applications of a weapon art and otherwise just run and skip through all content.

In summary, I feel like this game has been mostly just made for YouTubers who need to make tier lists. I got this on sale for around 35US. Kind of wished I'd waited for the sub $20 sale though. If you're a superfan, you've already bought this. If you're merely a ""fan"" who likes to maybe play a From game now and then I'd wait for a steep discount. 7/10",True

I recommend this game for anyone and everyone. The ""difficulty"" of the game is not a game problem but just another barrier that you are trying to figure out how to overcome. Never stop. Always keep pushing forward, even if progress is slow and it feels obsolete, keep pushing. You must become the Elden Lord.

,112143688,"Only 10 mins in the game, and I notice that there is a HUGE input lag when dodge/rolling, this is ridiculous, never happened in ds3 or bloodborne, hopefully I'll find a fix for this before continue playing, cuz melee is what im here for. Googled and found a bunch of other people who has the same issue, not sure if it just the dual sense (prob not), but only the roll is affected, other actions are all fluid and nice.

edit: sometime it drops the roll completely, quick button release or not. no v-sync disable option in setting so can't try and fix this with that, this shit feels clunky as hell. There are some other ways with nvidia panel to disable it, but even this doesn't fix it completely

edit 2: refunding until they fix this bs, glad I noticed this the moment the game start, and since I'm not ready for a 100+ hrs of frustrating experience, this seems like the best way to go

edit 3: 
Coming back to this after over a year since I just remember about this after playing AC6, follow this: /watch?v=8-d70OcYP1c
to fix this problem permanently. If ur on PS5, disable HDR.
Great game, didn't have the best launch, and after some googling, it seems that they still have not fixed this issue, and it has become the Skyrim giant flinging you into the sky with 1 hit bug that was never fixed.

Do your job Fromsoft...",False
,133285077,"Man, what a game. 

This was my introduction into the 'souls like' genre and I am personally a big fan of this game style. Ever since I began playing Elden Ring, I always wanted to keep playing it, even though I was getting absolutely flattened by everything, which is a rare feeling. 

Elden Ring's bosses are uniquely hard and challenging in their own way, meaning you never get bored. The sheer size of the map is incredible with separate underground areas, catacombs, caves and tones of other interesting and diverse locations. Fromsoft games have a reputation of being very re-playable and Elden Ring doesn't fall short of this fact. 

Elden Ring's game-play is nothing like I've ever seen before and it's really awesome.

Also, be prepared to open Youtube because there's so much stuff that I found difficult and was confused about on my first playthrough, its just so complex. 

I have experienced a lot emotions while playing this game, one of them being anger, a lot of it. But when you finally defeat that boss that you have been at for hours, it is so rewarding and makes you feel like you've accomplished a great acheivement. 

Elden Ring does have a fair few bugs and glitches in it and I wouldn't say it's a perfect game at all. But the re-playability and entire atmosphere that it brings with it just makes it a wonderful experience.

In short conclusion, Elden Ring is by far the best game I've ever played.",True

,148764456,"When I first picked up Elden Ring, i had not really touched a From Software title, and I was probably in one of the lowest points in my life, But as I beat a boss and then beat another I started to realize that, Shutting up and keeping moving forward is all you can do in a hard time and continue to get back up when a great challenge knocks you down. Towards the end of my playthrough I felt like I did not have what it took to complete the game and a boss, try after try continued to defeat me. But instead of giving up it started a over 1000 hour training arch through Sekiro, Bloodborne, Darksouls 1, 2, and 3 and aswell as Demon souls, I actually ended out platinuming Sekiro when I was finished. I completed all these tasks and guess what I came back. Stomped all the Achievement based bosses in Eldenring and giving that bastard that gave me such a hard time a run for its money. Moral of the story is, Never give up, keep pushing forward and the love God my brothers and sisters. Never go hollow, Never allow shura's evil to grab ahold of you and make you his puppet. Best of all Praise the Sun, it will always rise in the morning. Much love to your art, you saved my life Hidetaka Miyazaki.

The number of different systems is also intense, from Shops, Side Shops, Secret Shops, Lanes, Jungle farming, creep spawning/stacking, etc.. It can be too much.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - A Timeless Epic Masterpiece

Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

As a passionate gamer who revels in grand adventures and deep storytelling, ""The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt"" is a testament to the pinnacle of the gaming industry. CD Projekt Red has crafted an absolute masterpiece, a world teeming with breathtaking landscapes, intricate tales, and characters that resonate with players long after the game's end.

From the very first step into the shoes of Geralt of Rivia, players are transported to a world of dark enchantment. The Continent is a vast and intricately detailed realm, pulsing with life, mysteries, and danger. It's not merely a setting; it's a living, breathing entity where every blade of grass, every tavern, and every forest feels tangible and authentic.

Character development is an art form, granting players the power to shape Geralt's skills, moral compass, and the course of his relationships. Geralt himself is a beautifully complex character, surrounded by a supporting cast that is equally fascinating. These characters are brought to life with exquisite writing and voice acting, ensuring that their stories are as memorable as they are profound.

The central narrative is an epic tale filled with personal quests, political intrigue, and ethical dilemmas. What sets ""The Witcher 3"" apart is its unflinching respect for players' intelligence and choice. Every decision has far-reaching implications, and the complexity of these choices is a reflection of life itself.

Combat is an exhilarating dance of blades and magic, where mastery of Geralt's swordplay and supernatural abilities is key. Battles against both mythical monsters and human adversaries are intense, challenging, and require cunning strategy.

The game's ethereal music and voice acting are the finishing touches that bring this world to life. The evocative melodies and superb voice performances elevate the experience to a level of immersion rarely seen in the gaming industry.

While ""The Witcher 3"" is an undisputed masterpiece, it's not without minor imperfections. A few players have encountered occasional technical hiccups, but these are mere blips in the grand tapestry of the game. The sheer size and scope of the world may be overwhelming for some, but it's a testament to the game's depth and scale.

In conclusion, ""The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt"" is not just a game; it's a timeless epic that transcends the medium. Its opulent world, multifaceted characters, gripping narratives, and demanding combat make it a landmark achievement that will resonate through the ages. If you seek grand adventures, intricate storytelling, and immersive open worlds, this game is not to be missed. Embark on a journey in the realm of Geralt of Rivia, where your choices determine the fate of a world that will etch itself into your heart.",True

One of my favourite games of all time - great story, great gameplay, the graphics are absolutely stunning too with all of the raytracing effects, and the soundtrack is nothing short of amazing and perfectly frames every moment. There's always something to do, a huge variety of places to discover and explore and many different challenges to face. Gwent especially was an adventure in and of itself!

Touching back on the story, without going into detail, it's... a ride no doubt. There are quite a few twists and turns, and especially deeper in it becomes a heck of an emotional rollercoaster

I did notice there are quite a few bugs in the next gen patch though which I didn't notice beforehand, saving and then loading that save normally helps though.

Also they say it's an RPG but for me it's a CGI movie with multiple cuts or, more accurately, a choose your own adventure book. It's not for everyone and people should stop recommending it to people who enjoyed Elder Scrolls type RPGs. You might love it if you are the target audience, but don't expect something like Zelda where you can self insert doing your own thing or something like Oblivion or Fallout where you feel you own the character and the story.

I was hesitant at first due to my preference for games where I can create my own character, but being Geralt is a blast. I never played the previous games or watched the show, so I was slightly worried about being dumped into something I didn't understand. Thankfully, it hasn't been a problem at all, and I'm enjoying learning as I go. 

The only problem I do have is that I frequently stop just to admire the game's beautiful scenery. It's seriously distracting. It's such a lovely setting that I don't even try to binge the game. I don't feel forced into long sessions to enjoy it. I can hop on for an hour, run around exploring the world, find some random places, kill some bad stuff, watch a few cutscenes, and feel like I've had an experience.

This is unequivocally the greatest RPG ever made.

I have played through the main game and all DLC multiple times and find myself coming back to it after the latest graphical additions that have been added.  CDPR is STILL putting effort and money into this title all these years later.  That tells you its a company passionate about their product, which is excellent news for gamers.

This game already has the story and gameplay down, now that the additions of Raytracing, DLSS, Frame Generation, Ultrawide Support (Incl in cutscenes) have been added, it looks as good as it plays.  

This is the game that got me into PC gaming back in the day, and its a the reason why I've upgraded my GPU.  I don't like the Netflix series but I LOVE this game.

I'm really hoping the next story in the saga is as fully developed as this game has been.  Good on you CDPR, thanks for all the memories!

This game forces you to explore to find interesting gear and punishes you for not preparing to conquer areas ahead. However, while doing that exploring never feels like a chore. You never feel like ""god just let me go through already"" the enemy placements will at first, force you to stop and look ahead and make you think about how to challenge them. The game also doesn't hand you any wins, there are no participation trophies here, everything you collect in this game you earned. whether it be 10 souls from killing a rat or it is a boss weapon that you forged from beating the boss that took you 50 tries to beat.

The enemy design is very simple at times with wyverns, rats, skeletons etc. but at other times it is also very intriguing and some of the most abstract designs in video games with bosses and other major enemies. This is a plus as when you see a very unique design in the game it serves as a warning, and it also drives your curiosity to find out how it fights but more importantly, how you can beat it.

This game also makes you feel like an adult, it tells you the controls and nothing else. Everything you need to figure out on your own. You need to explore and find things that tell you where to go, whether they be NPCs or the description on items. The only thing limiting you in this game is your drive to explore and learn more about the world.

Let me paint a picture for you:
You've attempted this fight 30 times each time falling short. You make your way back to the boss arena, you've mastered the area before it maximizing your health entering the boss fight. The music kicks in, a beautiful orchestra accompanied by a choir of operatic chants. The stage is set, you know all of the bosses moves, you know exactly how the fight is going to go, you planned your strategy ahead of time, you use your buffing item that you learned the boss is weak to by reading the texts in the game and inferring with the knowledge you've accumulated over countless battles. The only thing to do now, is execute your plan to perfection. You start out strong dodging his moves and weaving in some counter attacks but you get a little greedy and get punished for it. your down, but not out. you fall back to recover but the boss doesn't let up. he keeps pushing you and you find yourself crumbling under the pressure, your plan is faltering. You pull off some miracle dodges and the boss finally calms down enough for you to stabilize. you get your bearings back, the buffs wore off but you still have plenty of life You start taking it slower, only going for 2 hits when you feel you can go for 3. slowly the boss is whittled down. The health bar is so low now. only a couple more hits and its over. you push your advantage you dodge aggresively. you swing, swing, swi- the boss counter attacks, waiting for the moment you got greedy and he hits you hard. your down to your last legs. both of you 1 combo away from death. the blood is pumping, the fear of having to do this again, the adrenaline of being so close to victory everything is telling you different things you cant get a thought into your head without contradicting it. ""play safe, run in, dodge and counter, bait an attack"" all of your options are in your head, the bosses hasnt done anything as if hes waiting for you to crumble under your own fear so he can finish you off. Then as the music swells, he charges in. the move you've seen countless times before, the move you've sworn to never die to again comes. you know exactly how to dodge it, where to optimally position your self after it to guarantee a counter hit. You feel it in your soul. you dodge, counter. its not enough your one hit away, the boss charges up his next attack, its coming, you have no time to decide what to do ""dodge or hit ? dodge or hit ? dodge or hit ? dodge or hit ?"" in under a second this one question bounces in your mind countless times you give in to your instincts and right as the bosses weapon is going to hit you, you swing your weapon and strike him down. You've conquered not only the boss but your doubts as well, you overcame it. the relief kicks in its finally over, the battle is won, but more still awaits.

Overall I would give DSR a 4/10 - worst game fromsoft has made to date for sure.

,122232868,"[h1] Dark Souls Remastered (Manuvision) [/h1]

Review by Unam 

Ah, good old Dark Souls. 

I'm a huge fan of the genre, playing and beating all of Fromsoftware's classics and I've enjoyed all of them (Yes, even Dark Souls II). Hell, I've even done an SL1 for Dark Souls III, and it was the most bittersweet experience of my life. I keep coming back to these games because I appreciate them as pieces of art and for being plain fun. Dark Souls is the second of the Soulslike genre, only being predated by Demon's Souls for the PS3. While not my favorite of the trilogy, Dark Souls is still a masterpiece and will likely hold up for ages to come. I adore this game, and I could end the review here and give it a 10.

[b]BUT[/b]

I'm reviewing this as a remaster of the original game, and that is where the package as a whole lacks. I'll review the game and then the remaster separately, and give it a single score. 

[h2]Part 1: Dark Souls [/h2]

In this portion, I'll discuss the original game. The game is a masterpiece. I find it incredibly amusing that this was only the second time Fromsoftware was dabbling with the genre. [b]They have managed to craft such an important landmark in gaming history, and their efforts and passion should never be unjustifiably doubted [/b]. I'll start with discussing the world, as that is my personal favorite part. Like other Soulslikes, the game offers extensive creation settings, allowing you to play whatever you want. The game also has a lot of different gameplay styles, including magic, pyromancy, miracles, and basic swords, axes, knives, and shields. You can literally play whatever you want to play, and it really helps with providing a lot of replayability. Out of the entire trilogy, Dark Soul's world remains the most interesting and innovative. All of the areas are so unique, from the soothing melodies of Firelink Shrine to the bloody atmosphere of Blightown and the haunted feels of New Londo Ruins, everything here feels so special and they all fit together perfectly. One of my favorite parts about the world is that it is all interconnected, and you never follow a straight path. As an example, in one playthrough I went straight to Undead Burg, which is most commonly the area where new people go, and in another playthrough, I went to the Catacombs. Sure, some areas are harder than others, but you can tackle the world in whatever direction you want, only being stopped by having to hit certain checkpoints along the story. What helps bring the world to life are the enemies, that are never recycled and are proprietary to a certain area, and they all fit with the tone of the environment. Along your journey, you will meet a few characters, and they all help guide you and give a brief description of your surroundings [Insert ""Praise the Sun"" joke here]. These characters tend to give you a glimmer of hope in this dark depressing world, which helps alleviate the player and gives tidbits of lore.  

Now, you can't go talking about Dark Souls without mentioning the bosses. While it doesn't have my personal favorite selection, some of the bosses are super iconic. There are roughly 26 bosses, with a few repeated ones. This is honestly a lot, but out of those 26, there are only 10 which are really good, with the rest ranging from decent to annoying. While this is fine, most tend to be super difficult, this is why most people use the phrase ""This is the Dark Souls of [genre]', speaking of which... 
Let me rant about the [u]DIFFICULY[/u]. The difficulty in Dark Souls is balanced, mostly dependent on the player's skill and willingness to repeat the action to make the difficulty. I'll set an example; You can literally grind the same enemy for 100 hours to get to level 300 and literally destroy anything in your path with a single hit, or, you could send yourself at level 1 and most certainly get destroyed in a single hit, it's up to you what you want to do. Personally, I would recommend against grinding unless you're feeling like you are under leaves for an area or boss. That's why I don't like the phrase ""Dark Souls is the hardest game ever made"" because it isn't and everyone that says that has probably never played the game. Hey, if you think it's the hardest game, all power to you, but you cannot deny its difficulty revolves entirely around the player. n

I especially adore the theme of [b]Perseverance[/b] in Dark Souls. [u]You are going to die, that is a fact and there is no way around that,[/u] but that is ok. The game is all about patience and not giving up. You are literally placed into one of the most demoralizing worlds ever and are placed against unsackable odds, yet you surpass them little by little, and adventure to find balance. This is what I love about Dark Souls. This is why I will never get tired of Dark Souls. [b]This makes it a masterpiece. [/b]

Dark Souls also received 1 piece of DLC, [u]Artorias of the Abyss[/u] and while you might groan, let me tell you that this is one of, if not the best, pieces of DLC I've ever played. It lets you explore new areas, battle new enemies, gather new weapons and spells, and fight new bosses. Bit of a spoiler, but Artorias and Manus are up there in my top 5 bosses of the entire series (My number one is Slave Knight Gael from DSIII if you're curious). It is an amazing appetizer for people that wanted more, and at the time of release, it was retailing for around $15 dollars at the time of release, which was a steal and puts into perspective how gamers are being mistreated nowadays, with DLCs of the same price only adding minimal content, a real shame. This is more Dark Souls, and if you loved the original experience you're going to love this. 

This is my review of Dark Souls and like I said before, it is excellent, I genuinely don't have a single complaint. I would give it a 10/10, but...

[h2] Part 2: Remastered Edition[/h2]'
[u]I don't like Dark Souls: Remastered.[/u] Let me put it into perspective. The original game came out in 2010 everywhere, where it was released for 60 dollars, like most other AAA games, and like other games, it became heavily discontinued after a few years, usually retailing between $15-$30 dollars. That's all and fine, but then in 2019 Bandai Namco alongside Fromsoftware announced a ""Remaster"" of the game. I put this in quotation marks because considering this a Remaster is a disservice to all Remaster. They literally slapped the game on Steam again, updated some textures, gave you the DLC, and called it a day. Now I'm going to list all the new features, ready?

1. ...

What's that? Do you think I made a spelling mistake? [u]No, the Remaster literally adds nothing new.[/u]. I wouldn't be complaining so much if they didn't delist the original version from Steam, furthermore, they didn't even give this as a free upgrade to the original owners, which is a complete spit in their faces. 

Here is what they should have done:

1. Rebuild the movement system so that it feels more fluid, much like Dark Souls III
2. Add a few more enemies and rework some of the bosses to give them a few more moves and make the fights more dynamic and make them feel less clunky.
3. Fix some of the glitches that the original game had.
4. Fix (or remove) Capra Demon. 

Not hard guys.

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
 
I adore Dark Souls, it is one of my favorite games ever. It will forever remain in my heart. It has created a community of hardcore fans that respect and love it. Its world and bosses are some of the most interesting in the area, and at the time it was released it put Fromsoftware on the map. It created the best trilogy in gaming and its monumental achievements cannot be understated. However, this Remaster is terrible. 

I give Dark Souls: Remastered a...
[h2] 8/10  [/h2]

I straight up quit several times, uninstalling the game and yet each time I found myself a couple of days later reinstalling it. It took me well over a month to get through this game but the rewarding feeling I had when I finally completed it was well worth the frustration. Great game!",True
,147560213,"Man i really tried to like this game holy hell, but honestly everything about the game feels clunky, frustrating and tedious. Your attacks never hit how you want them too, controls are god awful with many things bound to the same few buttons (though i hear its much nicer on controller). constant backtracking for seemingly no reason, awful collision with enemies constantly blocking your path in tight spaces and your weapons bounce off walls so you can barely do anything about it.

Now i dont usually do reviews but im writing this mainly because i genuinely want someone to tell me why people like this game, none of the steam reviews say anything more specific than very general statements or just praising the difficulty, none of my friends who like the game can explain anything specific either. I think this game originally came out at a time when games were getting easier and all the reactionaries loved this game because it felt like a 90s game (probably the only game series for which saying it feels like its from the 90s is praise somehow), so it feels like people are more praising the game for some philosophical reasons rather than the actual gameplay itself. 

The only thing i hear people say is fun is ""getting better"" at the game but honestly when the gameplay is so clunky and tedious i feel like its more a case of needing to get better in order to even be able to progress in a game that is at it's core just a mediocre action game. And ok this may be the most problematic part of this review but honestly the game isn't even really difficult despite that being what everyone praises, as almost every death feels much more like you dying for some stupid reason and every time i'd die i wouldn't think something like ""i need to read the enemies attack better"" or ""i need to be more precise in my movements"", but instead something like ""damn i was stuck in a corner and couldnt do anything against 3 enemies when i couldnt even swing my weapon without hitting a wall and got stunlocked to death"".

I might be missing or not getting something in which case i'd happily let someone change my mind because it seems like all the aspects people praise is much more them coping than anything, with common praises being things like ""it doesnt hold your hand"", ""it feels like a game from the 90s"", ""the game is challenging"", but when you look at those statements none of the is praise its just a statement like the game has open exploration, feels dated and is tedious. Most people who praise the game just say something like ""oh yeah youre just bad if you dont like it"" or something of the sort but honestly ive played way harder games that were way more fun but the reason why those games were fun is because the core gameplay was always interesting, and it always felt fair and deserved, while dark souls 1 combat isn't particularly interesting and deaths feel more undeserved than anything, and the controls as well as not getting bored and impatient pose a bigger threat to you than the actual enemies in this game.

Honestly maybe its a sunk-cost thing, where you spend countless hours battling the controls and running through the same areas, and by the time you learn how to actually play the game, you make yourself believe youre having fun so as to not admit you wasted all that time on a mediocre game, and nobody wants to admit it so instead everyone just collectively decided to pretend to enjoy it or something and that all the bad game design is somehow actually incredible game design if you have 3 shots, squint your eyes really hard, and repeat the phrase ""its hardcore"" 99 times in front of a mirror.

I must admit however the one thing i can't comment on is the story and soundtrack since i definetly havent played enough to really get to see a lot of it so even though i don't find them anything special, ive definetly not progressed far enough to either hear the ""good tracks"" or witness the story or something. This is a pretty important point as i have many times played through games with awful controls and many tedious elements because the story and music were really good so i could see that changing my mind.

Once again, I ask someone to change my mind because i've genuinely tried really hard to get into these games and see anything positive but I just cannot, no matter how hard I try.",False

Not Recommending due to the poor job the REMASTERED version received, it was just a re-release, they could had worked more on it for the price asked. 

Aside from that, Dark Souls is a unique experience, and each game should be on your library, as each one of them is a masterpiece from the gaming universe no doubt. 

Me being an OG, from Shadow TOWER on PS1, to Eternal Ring on PS2 and the Kings Field Series across, this one is a must on the expansive FROM SOFTWARE works. 

I recommend buying it on a sale if you don't got the PTD edition.

,48606215,"i love the game, but the remastered brought nothing noteworthy to it. it should have been an update instead of a cashgrab. it esp pales in comparison to Blue Points remaster of Demon Souls; if the DaS Remastered would have gotten the same treatment i would happily pay the full price again.

fixed issues: 
- jump is on L3 instead of Circle, which is also the key to run
- multiplayer: you can actually get summoned and summon this time; gravelording seems to be easier/working as well

not fixed issues: 
- fps issues: what would be small stutters in any 2018 game, like droping ~5fps brings the remaster down to 30fps, that feel like 10fps
**- jumping: the game originally was in 30 fps and if u play the PC version u get 60 fps, but the jump distance is halfed **(seems fixed, had no problem with the longer jumps on 2nd playthrough)
- lagging multiplayer (lagstab)
- multiple ledges/clipping environment still exist (ie great hollow, lost izalith, ...)

Pardon me but i'll need some time for playthrough 2&3...
Review coming once i have finished it.

Here we are, game finished.

This version is pretty bad compared to the OG.
There's a ton of imput delay and for some reasons the chosen undead randomly starts walking a bit whenever.

Those two things nuked builds that aren't long range or turtle.

Dex and parrying all the time is out of the window, weapons with long attack animations too.

The graphical and framerate upgrade is just not worth it.

You're better off sticking to the original PC version and use DSfix or get it on PS3.

It's still an incredible game but it's the worst From Software port i've seen yet.

I will say, I don't understand the hype around this game. In all the other souls games I've played, I've rarely felt cheated or cheesed. I lost count of how many times I got hit my attacks I felt I dodged, got combo-ed by a boss or stun locked by normal enemies. With that being said, I did find myself laughing at some of these deaths and I did enjoy my time in Lordran.

Gonna try and do some pros and cons I had with the game I guess:

[h2]PROS[/h2]

- The bosses felt fair for the most part and all were fun to fight
- Enemies are relatively easy to dodge and backstab looping is always a blast
- Upgrade materials are readily available until late game, costing an appropriate amount of souls to buy and are dropped somewhat regularly from normal enemies
- The setting is great

[h2]CONS[/h2]

- The lack of early game fast travel leads to some fun instances where you spend 30 minutes running between areas of the map just to unlock the ability to upgrade your weapons more or to allow you to upgrade your flasks (since you can only carry one fire keeper soul at a time...)
- Boss run-backs are atrocious. I hope you enjoy running for 5-10 mins to get back to the boss and then spend 3 seconds fighting it before getting true combo-ed.
- Many areas felt barren or pointless, they were only there to add needless complexity or to add difficulty getting back to the bosses
- You need a consumable to kill certain enemies that costs 4000 souls (stupid ghosts in new londo)

,147231432,"It took about 10 hours for the game to really click for me and that's when I started enjoying it. I really didn't like it at the start and didn't get the appeal. By now, I finally understand why people like the souls games. I still really dislike the PvP though. Having someone with 1k hours in the game just destroy you randomly sucks. At least you can entirely avoid this by just being hollow most of the time and only being human when you need it and don't care about dying.

Surprisingly, I haven't gotten super frustrated with this game. With the exception of PvP, when you die, it's at least 95% of the time your fault and it feels fair. Failure doesn't feel as bad when it was the result of your own actions. I get much angrier at multiplayer FPS games.

As for this being a ""remaster,"" it's pretty much the same as the original game. Just a different lighting system that changes the game's feel in an overall negative way, but the game runs at a stable 60fps even at 4K resolution for me so it doesn't really matter as much. If it ran poorly AND looked dated, then I would have an issue with it.



For anyone who is reluctant to play the game or isn't enjoying it yet, all while likely being told to ""git gud"" by the gatekeepers of the community, just keep going. It'll take a while for it to click, but you'll steadily improve and your experience will get better alongside your skills. The game never lets up in terms of difficulty, but you'll get better at handling all of the doodoo feces it likes to throw at players until you can just clown on all the enemies.

But unlike some modern games, the story is worth the effort, and it is like a puzzle mini-game inside the game itself, so I enjoy it.

Combat feels much more basic, heavier, and strategic compared to its succeeding genre offshoots like Nioh and other games in the Dark Souls trilogy. I was literally thrown off at some point by how heavy the combat felt, and when I went back and played a session of Nioh, which revolves around fast-paced combat, I couldn't play the same fast-paced combat again. But this does not detract from the godly first experience that you will have in this game. The feeling of exploring some area where you feel that you can't escape and then finally finding a shortcut or a bonfire is exhilarating and fun. The environment will kill you most of the time, and that's fine with me because it adds to the experience [spoiler](except for Anor Londo Archers and Sen's Funhouse; those two will always be a nightmare for the first playthrough)[/spoiler].

This game encompasses all of my favorite things about video games. Good combat, an amazing story, the feel of discovery in an open world (technically, it is a semi-linear open world), and finally, an experience to remember. Overall, I really can't recommend this game enough; it is worth its full price, and you can get an even better deal if you buy it whenever it is on sale.",True

本作最大的特点是非常出色的地图设计，整个地图自成一体：不同地区往往以意想不到而又合理的方式连接在一起，而地区内部和环境相融合的路径也非常巧妙。
与地图相比，其他方面则显得稚嫩逊色了。前期地图显得过于”开放“，能去好几个地方，但有的路如果等级不够会很吃苦；怪物设计的动作、交互方式都较为简陋；此外，本作人物翻滚性能较弱，盾的性能则过于强大，盾反判定非常简单，反而成了“万用解法”。
受苦方面，本作篝火非常稀疏，且前期没有传送（这也和地图特点有关），阴人的地方也不少。不过我感觉还好，主要是因为我使用刷魂bug刷了蛮多魂，升到了一百多级，容错率大大提高。对于现代来玩的玩家，我觉得用这种方式可以规避无意义的受苦，获得更好的游戏体验，值得推荐。",True

The hardest part of the game is enemy placements but this is balanced by almost every boss being a cakewalk compared to anything you'd find in a more modern Souls game like Elden Ring. I'd routinely die in each area by getting swarmed by 8 enemies I couldn't see or falling down a very annoyingly-placed hole or an enemy smashing through a wall and one-shotting me only to finally reach the boss and faceroll them 9 times out of 10.

1. The game has a poor location design. They are just stuffy (enemies are weak but there are a TON of them in every place, and that is why this is tough, not because mobs are challenging, which is unbearably disgusting).
2. Input is lagging and weird, at least on the keyboard and mouse. Every time I start the game, I need to open the settings and re-adjust the mouse clicking because it is not working at every opening of the game. Whenever I try to attack, it does the action with a 2-second delay until I change the mouse settings back and forth.
3. I played with a two-handed halberd and it was awful because of the weapon breaking. It was breaking after like 20 hits and there is no spare titanite to upgrade an alternative weapon, at least for the first half of the game. For the second half of each location, I played with less powerful equipment. Nice!
4. The hollowing system... For half of the game, I had not had enough effigies to cure it, so my health bar was 50% of its original size. As a result, two hits and I was dead. Nice!

DLCs are good, though.

          The locations are great, but some of them gave me that rushed development vibe for some reason.
In comparison to the ds1 though, which brought more joy, the story feels deeper and more well written I guess. 
        Characters are also cool and their presence is just enough to not distract you from achieving some main tasks.

",True
,114190781,"This game gets bad rap despite fixing a lot of the really annoying problems in DS1 like arbitrary lack of warping and long annoying boss runs (for the most part). That said, playing this game after DS3 and Elden Ring, the combat is more antiquated and clunky. Enemies are much less animated and interesting, and the pace of the fights is much slower. Overall this game is probably the easiest of every fromsoft game I have played, although thats probably because its DS1 - stupid bullshit = slightly easier game. While the world is more chaotic and less coherent than in dark souls 1 (or 3), the story is actually very interesting and different than the kind of story those were going for, beyond a superficially similar general premise. 

The DLCs are absolutely fantastic and taken by themselves some of the most compact and juicy this series has ever seen. 

The negatives mostly come down to some of the bosses not being winners (twin dragonriders, congregation fight, didnt even fight the big dragon tbh everyone said to skip it) some stupid things (i love losing half my health when i die thats fun, i love that they kept how in DS1 ur character looks like beef jerky when they are hollow, why do enemies despawn if you kill them 15 times that so arbitrary, what in the lords name is the ""adaptability"" stat) 

I think if you liked DS1 and dont have some bizarre psychosexual attraction to how that game did specifically everything, you will really like this game too, perhaps even more.  Probably not more than 3 tho.

,137662281,"As someone who has beaten SOTFS 15+ times between console and PC, I decided to give the vanilla a try because, why not more Dark Souls?

This is the better version of the game.  The enemy placement is much more practical. This is especially noticeable in areas like the Iron Keep. SoTFS dumped a significant amount of random enemies throughout the world that just served as an annoyance - I am no longer consistently dying to frustrating ganks caused by enemy spam. I also find myself clearing out areas more strategically, as opposed to running straight through which i did frequently in some of the annoying areas of Scholar.

Furthermore, the use of the fragrant branches makes much more sense. There are multiple statues that exist in Scholar to block you from progressing that simply don't exist in the vanilla version. I remember in Scholar having to backtrack multiple times to find a fragrant branch, so I can open up a blocked path (example: Lost Bastille before Ruin Sentinals, Black Gulch 2nd bonfire). 

Lastly, the visuals are exactly the same. Frames are fine, textures are fine, it all feels like the same game. 

TL:DR; When compared to SOFTS, Vanilla DS2 has better enemy placement and world design, and runs exactly the same for me from a performance standpoint. It's sad that FromSoft re-released this game with a new price tag on it, yet seemingly made it worse. Vanilla DS2 is simply a more pleasant experience.",True

DS2 is led by two directors with Miyazaki placed in the Supervisor role, and I think it's cool that they allowed others to bring their vision to life in the world of Dark Souls & expanding on the world with it, but I think if Miyazaki was a bit more than a supervisor, things may have been a bit better. That doesn't mean just fire the directors and give Miyazaki the role, but I think he could've been more involved considering Dark Souls is his child.

DS2 is a decent game and is more underwhelming than bad, and it's not nearly as bad as many people say I think. It could be much better, but the directors had a vision and when it comes to story & narrative, they did a good job. Just think if Miyazaki was a bit more involved, things could be a bit better.

DS2 is also full of it's own lore and for a while none of it seems connected at all to Dark Souls 1, but the farther you get and the more research you do, you will see the amount of connections that there are. It's cool!

The increased speed of Dark Souls 3 and Elden Ring turned me off, DSII is the perfect opposite; they won't make another game with the same philosophy again.
Tactical, slow and with an atmosphere that breaks with the traditional brooding nihilism of the other Souls games. DSII is not a bad souls game, it was Dark Souls forking out toward a different design direction. I think it succeeded in being the next logical evolution to the Souls formula.

(This does not, however, apply to Scholar of the First Sin, which is a poor excuse to add minor details that could have been attached to this game, but hey, greedy business practice.)

My favorite things about this game is the aforementioned lore and the viability of each weapon and armor, and you can boast whatever fashion and weapon you like and feel like a total badass fighting what are, in my opinion, tougher bosses than Dark Souls I or III have to offer. As usual, the DLC is far superior to the base game as the base game's final boss is meh.

Unfortunately, I will say that the multiplayer is pretty dead now (though it depends on your Soul Memory - essentially the matchmaking mechanic based on how many souls you've accumulated over time) and is much more alive on Scholar of the First Sin, so if you're reading reviews between this game and that one, I urge you to purchase the games based on this:

More enjoyable PVE experience: Dark Souls II
More multiplayer: SoTFS

Scholar is packed with typical sleazy and dirty Tanimura design tricks like throwing as many packs of enemies upon you as possible and placing enemies in blind corners to strike you off guard. For me that is not about tactical gameplay and not how a typical From title should be designed. DS1, 3 and BB don’t have these cheap tricks. Vanilla DS2 feels different in this as wel in my opinion. There also is something off with the lightning or shading and excessive bloom in Scholar. Never could adapt to it. The gfx look a bit more pleasant in vanilla DS2 compared to Scholar.

Overall - great. Tons of variety. Every weapon is viable which is wonderful because there's no end to the builds you can put together. Combat is fast and fun. 

Yes, it's tough but not as tough as I thought it would be. There were only one or two sticking points I encountered, but I felt that the game provided me with numerous ways to solve those problems. Me being a total scrub, I relied a lot on summoning phantoms for boss fights, which made a lot of the fights incredibly easy. Between boss fights, there were a few areas where I decided to farm the enemies to extinction (they don't respawn if you kill them 12 times) to make my life easier. It was a good way to level up and also made the boss runs simpler.

Story: I feel like this game was quite disconnected from the first one. Dark Souls 2 focuses on a corner of the established world rather than the sweeping universal threat that Dark Souls 1 places an emphasis on. The world isn't as dead as the first game, which was a welcome change. 

I do feel that Dark Souls 2 lacks that sombre, melancholic, wistfulness the first game managed to capture so well. In general the world design is nice but it did leave me scratching my head at times (entering an area via a tunnel and when you turn around, it's just open ocean). Where Dark Souls 1 was this believably interconnected world, Dark Souls 2 is kind of all over the place. Teleporting between bonfires was a very welcome addition.

It was fun. I'll miss it as I venture into Dark Souls 3. I'll miss the waves crashing on the shores of Majula, and I'll miss Shanalotte telling me she'll be by my side ""until hope fades"".",True

+ Huge weapon arsenal and most weapons are quite viable
+ Magic looks majestic and hits like a truck
+ Crypt blacksword
+ Bonfire ascetics and powerstancing are amazing features and aren't in most other souls games
+ Some of the best NG+ content I've ever seen
+ First half is very non-linear and allows you to go to many different path simultaneously (second half is more linear, but also had some great locations)
+ DLCs were very challenging and masterfully designed
+- Most of the difficulty comes from fighting multiple enemies at once (I personally liked it, but understand why others might not)
- Adaptability, which makes rolling easier and lets you heal faster, is very important, yet poorly exlained
- Soul memory is a big hassle when trying to do jolly cooperation
- Bosses are not very challenging, and some are reused

Dark Souls II probably gets a bit of flak for being a tad different than Dark Souls 1 and Darks Souls 3, but that's probably what makes it such a banger of a game.  It feels like devs went out of their comfort zone to create a new Dark Souls game, and Dark Souls 3 is where they went back to their roots.

,133783150,"First off, quick PSA: DO NOT GET SCHOLAR OF THE FIRST SIN. BUY THIS VERSION, SCHOLAR IS A SCAM.

Scholar apparently does a couple balancing tweaks here and there, which may sound nice except that the main thing that Scholar changes is enemy placement. Scholar adds significantly more enemies to certain areas, making those areas exponentially more difficult and unfun. This is a major problem as Scholar promotes itself as the ""definitive"" version of Dark Souls II, meaning gullible new players (such as myself) will buy it, thinking they're getting an authentic experience, only to ragequit after the first few levels because of the ridiculous enemy spam, which only serves to compound the divisive-at-best reputation this game has. Vanilla Dark Souls II (this version) actually has smart enemy placement and a reasonable difficulty curve, making it much easier to deal with some of the games (admittedly significant) flaws, and even actually have fun. This version also still has the DLC, so you aren't missing out on that if you don't get Scholar. 

Moving onto thoughts on the actual game: I enjoyed it way more than Dark Souls I, however it's not as good as Dark Souls III. Your mileage on the game will depend on your playstyle. This game is slow. Your character is slow, but enemies are also slow, so you're encouraged to take a more strategic and methodical approach to combat. As a result, you're often expected to deal with larger groups of enemies at a time, and it works surprisingly well if you take the time to learn it. A big thing that helps surprisingly, is to not use the lock-on feature, as you have more range of motion when locked off, so you'll be able to dodge attacks more easily, and enemies are slow enough that you're able to move the camera yourself. If you're willing to take the time to learn this style of combat, you'll likely have a good time with this game. 

That being said, this game does have some major flaws that will understandably turn people off. They certainly turned me off when I played Scholar and had to deal with the BS enemy spam. 

1. Hitboxes. The hitboxes for enemy attacks are often very large, while the hitboxes on your weapons are seemingly pixel-perfect. As such, sometimes you'll get hit by attacks that it looked like you dodged, and smaller weapons like the broadsword have trouble comboing because the first swing knocks some enemies out of range of the second. Playing locked-off can usually mitigate this issue, since the larger range of motion will give you a wider dodge. 

2. Healing. This game introduces a new healing item known as lifegems, and they essentially make your estus nearly obsolete. You can move while using it, while estus locks you in place for a painfully slow animation. They also heal you slowly, meaning you can pop a few of these at once and essentially have a passive regen effect, allowing you to tank way more damage than you otherwise would be able to. Finally, while they are consumable, there's an NPC you unlock in the early game that sells an infinite number of them, so you'll literally never run out. I don't see why they couldn't have just made it so that you could move while sipping and left out the gems altogether. 

3. The Curse. Every time you die, your max health decreases slightly, and caps when you reach half health. To get your health back, you have to pop a Human Effigy, which is this game's equivalent to Humanities/Embers/Rune Arcs, etc. And these things are pretty scarce in the early game. They do get more common later, and there's a ring that caps the debuff to 3 quarters health instead of half, but it's still a pretty dumb punishment for death. Dark Souls I and III had a better system with their equivalent items. 

4. Adaptability. This game introduces a new stat called Adaptability, which controls the amount of invincibility frames you get when you roll. In the previous game, your i-frames were determined by your equip load (light/mid/fat), and it later titles like III and Elden Ring give you the same amount of i-frames for each type of roll, and the speed of the animation changes more drastically. Dark Souls II still has those 3 tiers of roll, but the i-frames are entirely dependent on that Adaptability stat, and you NEED to level that if you want a decent roll, especially with this game's hitboxes. It's an interesting idea, since you could potentially do a dodge build and have an overpowered roll, but considering how rolling is such an integral part of souls combat, it really shouldn't be something that you have to actively dump levels into and change drastically over the course of the game. I've found for a decent Dark Souls III style roll, your Adaptability should be around 20-30, although you can get by with less. 

5. This isn't really a flaw, I actually really like this about the game, but some people might not like it. A vast majority of the enemies and bosses in this game are big dudes in armor that are mechanically similar to each other. I like it since the armor is cool looking and they're fun to fight, but others might not like it as much. 

TL/DR: Dark Souls II is a fun game if you're willing to put some time in to learn it, and enjoy the style of combat that it promotes. In my opinion, it's better than the first game, though not as good as the third. Don't make my mistake and get Scholar of the First Sin. It's a scam.",True

,133690650,"I can’t speak for Scholar of the First Sin, but this version of DS2 is an incredible game. Aside from a brief adjustment period to some new mechanics, DS2 is a creative and strong entry in the DS series. 

Often called the weakest of the three, that by no means make it a bad game. My biggest gripe so far is there are a few really miserable boss run backs but the caveat is most of the bosses are super approachable. But make sure you invest points in your ADP early !! It’s an easy mistake to make, but doing it early makes the game really approachable as a whole.

The lore is some of the most engaging in the series, and while there aren’t characters quite as memorable as Solaire, others like Aldia, Vendrick, Lucatiel, and Nashandra all bring gravity, humor, and tragedy to a world that exists on cycles of light and dark.

The DLC's are where the difficulty spike really shoots WAY up.  The base game is legitimately easy in comparison.  Honestly though, even after beating all three DLC's completely, I think I legitimately regret playing them; it was more frustration than it was fun.  Just ball blastingly stupid.

,133220614,Great,True
,133214774,Play this over SOTFS edition of the game.,True
,133197505,"Easily the worst in the series but still a good game overall. The pros are that it is still a Dark Souls game with all the good that comes with that, the cons are as follows. The biggest issues are the bosses and annoying difficulty design. There is not much to say about the bosses, most are relatively easy and boring with nothing to write home about. The other games in the series are not designed with the express intent of difficulty, rather they focus on creating a fun and interesting challenge for the player. Dark Souls II does not follow this philosophy and there were a lot of instances of really annoying artificial difficulty just for the sake of it.

There were a lot of other nit picks that just seemed off to me about this game. Lots of animations felt stiff and awkward. Mainly on my character when walking with a weapon, my character would dramatically swing their shoulders in a weird fashion. The way they hold their weapon also looked off, especially when in power stance. lots of weapons would miss their target even when locked on, and the action in general just felt a bit weird. I couldn't find any armor that I liked until almost the end of the game. When you get hit, sometimes you can lose up to half your health without any sort of reaction or anything from your character which always came off strange. All that being said easily the worst design choices in the game are the health and rolling i-frames. I hate how you are punished with reduced max HP every time you die, and this just takes away from the try and try and try again until you succeed loop. You get enough items to get your health back to max that it usually did not matter, especially because most of the bosses are not very hard, but on those rare occasions of a hard boss I really hated this mechanic. And not much can be said about the i-frames issue, besides it makes early game feel really shitty until you get that stat raised to 30. If you play this just keep in mind it will be a flawed experience, but still a good one overall. This game is not nearly as bad as I was lead to believe, and am still glad I played it.",True

,109439149,"Overall the game is quite not bad. But in my opinion its the worst game in the series. First of all, why the hell do i need to level up rolling? Its just useless. They should have made it the same, like in ds1 and DS. Then there are bosses. The bosses seemed really easy, (not including dlcs) but getting to them was not. I liked the level design like in every dark souls game. But I was really sad that it wasnt so connected like in ds1 :(. For its age its really good. I cant talk about PVP becouse i havent played it, but im sure its great like in other dark souls. I also think that ds2 is the most frustrating of all dark souls. It also contains alot and i mean ALOT of items and consumables. Some of them could be removed, but i think its a nice touch to the game. I didnt do all of the achievements like in ds1 or ds3, but im really looking foward to it, since the game is not that hard when you learn it. So yeah... git gud and praise the sun.

In comparison to Elden Ring the game is linear which in my opinion made it way more balanced when it comes to not be overleveled for bosses. (which I hated in Elden Ring since story bosses (except a couple like Malenia, etc.) just became too easy because you tried to explore and got too much souls.)
In general the bosses in this game are just great [spoiler] (Abyss Watchers, Princes, Soul of Cinder, Sister Friede, Midir, Gael, Pontiff only to name a few) [/spoiler] Both dlcs but especially The Ringed City are worth the money and unlock several bosses which are probably some of the best in any souls game.

Exploring Lordran (DS1) is such an immersive and emotionally potent experience and while Lothric (DS3) is beautiful and wonderfully detailed it just lacks the wondrous feeling of trekking down a lonely path and ending back up in Firelink.

1. It doesn't demand the same amount of dedication and time from every player. If you want to play it casually and just finish the base game, it will not take a lot of time (10 to 20 hours, going in blind) and it's not going to be super hard. But, if you want to get some sort of a ""true ending"", lore-wise, it's going to be much more challenging. If you fall in love with the game, like I did, and want to beat 112% and maybe all achievements, get ready to be humbled. In summary, the game doesn't feel too overwhelming for a newcomer, but it will take a lot of time to enjoy everything it has to offer.

2. Since the game is not 3D, and the mechanics are so fluid and rich, I never blamed the game for getting hit and dying. In so many games, it feels like it's the game's fault, but in Hollow Knight it's always clear what went wrong and, eventually, what you could have done differently. It kind of ruins most of other 2D games.",True

,98990278,"So first thing first I want to start by saying that I did not finish the game, I can't (EDIT: I DID WITH HELP FROM A FRIEND I STILL DON'T LIKE THE GAME THO)
I will explain why but first let me give you a bit of context:
This game was recommended to me an insane amount, every other person saying that it's ""The best game"" or ""My favorite game"" so naturally my expectations went high and I was happy to start playing it.
The first few hours of the game were normal, nothing too interesting just walk and slash and explore a large map and I mean a LARGE map and this is where my first problem start to occur, you have to walk back and forth a lot on top of that you have to remember where you need to go, I am a person with very short memory and because I played this game weekly (2 3 hour-long sessions every week) I kept forgetting where I need to go the game is not clear at all on where you need to go now, so most of my time in the game I spent was just walking and trying to find where to go, and sometimes it's not about memory that gets me confused on where to go, sometimes you just have to guess that the slightly shaking rocks you saw 3 hours ago will now break to the new upgrade you got, and I don't know about you but I don't always remember or care if I saw rocks shaking like my reactions the first time was ""Oh this rock is a bit unstable"" and forgot about it immediately, why would I remember it? Also speaking of getting upgrades, the pacing were you get upgrades/new abilities is painfully slow so for the first hours of the game it feels so samey, sure the environment changes but you, the player stay the same for the most part, most upgrades are there for you to expend the map and not to make the game more fun in any way. (Like down smash and crystal heart)
So in short I kept getting lost in the map with the game being extremely unclear, I kept not knowing where to go combined with the pacing of the game being very slow I was just stuck in endless boredom.
I know a lot of people enjoy this game and I'm all for it, but sadly it just wasn't for me.

EDIT: I would also like to add that the platforming never gets more intersting except getting a double jump and a dash (which should be the basics) you never get any cool new abilities (form what I played at least) that make the platforming fun, it will almost always be just run and jump, which I think is subjective if you like that or not, but I think if your game is a platformer the platforming should be fun and should not be skiped when considering in development.

TL;DR
I spent 90% of my playtime trying to find where to go than actually playing because of my short memory and the platforming never got better",False

,148384612,"This is more than a great game, this is a piece of modern art. You sink into this world, discovering more and more reasons to love it and to keep returning. It's the best in its genre of metroidvanias - exploration-focused, non-linear games. So much work, love and care was put into its creation, from level design, to visual art, to music and dialogue. What deserves most praise perhaps, is the game's story.
Hollow Knight has a beautiful and deep lore that captivates despite its innate tragedy, themes of grief and loss.

[Spoilers ahead]
It can be read as a cautionary tale about the dangers of rebelling against nature and time, a reminder that nothing does and nothing can last forever. The foolish King who though himself above Nature sacrifices everything he has to delay the inevetible, turns into a tyrant and dies alone, abandoned, just like his Kingdom.

It can be also perceived as a deep personal tragedy of a man who failed to be a god his people needed him to be, who was forced to sacrifice his own child, whom he loved, in order to save everyone else. A tragic story of Hollow Knight, who was never just a Vessel, a weapon against Radiance, but a living human being, struggling to meet impossible expectations. Finally, the tragedy of Seer, penanced for the crimes not her own, but of her people, against their creator and mother. Suffering alone, gaining some sort of redemption, only to be ultimately forgotten and lost forever.

But Hollow Knight is a mature story that knows the light side to its dark one. It's also a story of everyone who followed Pale King and gave their live for Hallownest. It's a story of witnessing wonder and learning to love a dying world, finding comfort in its gloom and new meaning in life. A story praising perseverance and strong will, showing the meaning of true heroism, sacrifice and love. It's a story of ascension and growing into a great hero, into a righteous leader.

To start off, this game has some of the best art and music that I have ever seen in a video game, period. The dark, gloomy atmosphere combined with the somber soundtrack automatically gives this game extra credit, and it only gets better from there. The combat, while simple at first, only becomes more complex and satisfying the more abilities you unlock. Almost every enemy and boss feels different from the last, and almost every boss so far has been immensely satisfying to defeat. While this game is hard, it is also fair. No challenge is impossible, as long as you keep trying. Now, if this game sounds fun, then stop reading reviews and go buy it, and I doubt you'll regret it.

,148318485,"[i]Hollow Knight[/i] is a great game. 

Throughout the experience, [i]Team Cherry[/i] showcases their mastery of the metroidvania gameplay, world design, and overall tone and atmosphere.  The experience is at its best when you slowly piece together ways to traverse the world, overcome the challenges of new enemies, and prevail over the various boss fights the game has to offer. I'd say that [i]Hollow Knight[/i] plays its exploration gameplay loop exceptionally well among these elements; if you're familiar with how puzzle games and their goal of making the player feel smart for accomplishing simple tasks, this is the philosophy that powers the exploration puzzles and forms satisfying solutions to each challenge.

As for [i]Hollow Knight[/i]'s difficulty curve, this game is consistently on the higher side of difficulty and you will always feel as if you're pushing a boulder up a steep hill at minimum or barely clinging onto a cliff edge at maximum. The game does offer a multitude of power-ups that will make the experience easier, but often these upgrades coincide with unlocking more difficult areas, resulting in a difficulty curve that remains at the same high throughout the game (with small exceptions). 

However, [i]Hollow Knight[/i] does have two primary issues throughout the game: pacing and narrative execution. At [i]Hollow Knight[/i]'s late game, the exploration portion of its gameplay loop disappears and you are effectively only left with challenges, either in special areas or bosses. While these challenges are still fun to go through, the shift immensely slows down progression as the game forces you to acclimate and overcome these challenges to get further progression. This portion felt like trying to demolish a brick wall with your fists. Despite this, the game gives you all the tools to succeed in these challenges, it is up to you to learn how to use them to their maximum efficacy. I suspect this problem arose due to all the bosses added throughout the years in DLC.

[i]Hollow Knight[/i] contains a more prevalent issue throughout its runtime: narrative execution. Throughout a large portion of the game, narrative is presented through in-game tablets and artifacts scribbled with cryptic messages in foreboding tones, along with typically somber character dialogue. The game expects a lot of effort from the player's part to unveil its story and follow along the journey. The issue with this execution is that it tends to be on the vague side and will leave you lost unless you ardently keep track of the game's events. I struggled to get hooked into [i]Hollow Knight[/i]'s story, which meant that when the major story beats of the game come your way, they often-time feel limb and weightless and as if events are happening on your screen simply to happen. 

This is a shame because [i]Hollow Knight[/i] does not bring a weak story to the table. If you ever do make the effort to piece together its narrative from the strewn-about sources, it can make those same emotionless moments feel riveting and powerful. However, due to the narrative insistently being presented in vague dialogue and inscriptions, the game failed to hook me into its climatic story beats and left me feeling as if I watched the end of a story without its beginning and middle. I believe this could be addressed by sprinkling strong story beats throughout the game rather than backloading the majority of them and hoping the player put in enough effort to be absorbed by them.

In face of my critiques, [i]Hollow Knight[/i] still offers a solid package. The metroidvania gameplay loop is perfected to an extent I've not seen before, with an interesting world and engrossing atmosphere (produced mainly by Christopher Larkin) predicating everything. 

I've said what I've said: [i]Hollow Knight[/i] is a great game.",True

,148287799,"After 310hrs on this game and only one achievement missing (P5... I'll get you one day !), I can safely say : I recommend it. 
The story telling is compelling, you need to search within the world for pieces of lore and you are not held by the hand through each step. It actually makes you think and plan ahead, which I find quite refreshing. Dying is punishing, and in the beginning you will die quite a lot but it gets easier and easier as you go through more and more challenges.  I love the soundtrack and art work, the teams in charge of this did an outstanding job. Moving around and combat are super satisfying once you unlock abilities and you have different endings possible depending on how much trouble you want to go through. This is a game that I love to revisit regularly, and thanks to the Godhome DLC, the game can have a very long life if you enjoy grinding through the pantheons. 
The first 1 or 2 hours felt a bit long for me in the beginning especially as I was not used to the lack of hand holding, but it's definitely worth it to hang in there. First play through is usually between 30 to 40hours, depending on how thorough you want to be and how much % completion you want. Then, you can easily get maximum completion in just a few hours (without speed running skips). 
Now, the only thing left for us to do is wait for Silksong... in the meantime... I'll be grinding P5...

 In a serious note the best part is how everything feels polished and that you don't need to worry that much about bugs or any other problems which is ironic being a game about literal bugs. I will say for people who are not into platformers or really long games you will cry in some of the segments. If you like games like Cuphead however this game is amazing and the story is well made. Definitely a must play for anyone who likes platformers, deep story, amazing art, and overall a good game to spend your time on.

(Would highly not recommend for people who have arachnophobia tho, rip bozos)",True
,148285001,This knight was in fact hollow,True
,148282458,"TLDR:
A gloomy grimdark tale of a young bug that takes on the role of a knight trying to figure out what has turned the kingdom of Hollownest into an infected bug-version of Blighttown.. In short, Hollow Knight is an Amazing Metroidvania and you should go play it immediately. On top of that you should recommend all your friends and family to play it as well, and on the double! Gently drown Team Cherry in cash so that we might get Silksong out faster! 

Hollow Knight is a game that truly defined what a great Metroidvania is all about. It is one thing to burst out of nowhere and bedazzle an already saturated market, but to do so and simply excel in all aspects available is nothing short of brilliant. Everything from the story, the worldbuilding, gameplay, artwork and graphics, upgrade system and general flow are polished to perfection and there is hardly a flaw present in this amazing game. First and foremost, I adore the storytelling in this game. It reminds me of the best parts of Dark Souls with its emerging narrative about a darkness manifesting in a realm at its peak only to descend into turmoil and madness. The characters you encounter each add to this story like layers of an onion in a perfect symmetry until it all ends in an epic finale. The handcrafted environment and cartoony yet dark presentation is truly magical and never has such a monochrome game been so colorful and rich in character, presence and atmosphere. The music is simply sublime and every song is perfectly encapsulating its area. The first time I entered City of Tears it actually brought tears to my eyes.. 

Combined with the aforementioned stellar presentation is a gameplay that's fluent, fast and elegant that really rewards the player for learning the rhythm of the game. The loop of fast and snappy combat combined with great traversal makes every bossfight come down to skillful execution and finesse rather than brute force and every step of the journey a joyous experience in gloomy contemplation. The power ups might be all familiar in this day and age but the intricate system of brooches that you can apply to give a slight edge on your journey are varied and unique enough that no two gameplays need be the same. Sure there are better ones but that only bothers the pure number crunchers in the community.  

As already mentioned. I highly recommend Hollow Knight. It is a stellar example of the best that Metroidvania has to offer. No other game has come close to the flawless package and even though some might find the atmosphere to bleak for their taste none can ignore the true beauty that has been exhumed from the bottom of a brooding entomologist collection.. Go get it, what are you waiting for!

,147244618,"Pains me to leave a negative review as I love CRPGs and a high quality CRPG like this should be an amazing game but I just can't get myself to finish it. Encounter design is just pure garbage and the main reason why I'm giving up on this game.

I got to level 14 and almost finished act 2 but I just don't want to play any more.

The good : 

- Graphics are pretty good.
- Music is amazing.
- Voice acting is really good.
- Progression system is decent enough if nothing super groundbreaking or exciting.
- I like the action point based system where each action during a turn cost a number of action points and you can essentially spend them however you want.
- Origin characters are pretty good and IMO there's basically 0 reason not to play an origin character since you can spec anyone however you want and can only take 4 characters with you into later acts.
- Story is ok but not groundbreaking and its not that hard but not super easy to follow, I played DOS 1 years ago and don't really remember what happened so I am having a hard time following the world's story and lore.

The bad :

- Loot system is just plain bad, having random diablo style loot in a CRPG where enemies don't respawn is incredibly stupid and I actually remember it was one of the reasons I stopped played DOS 1 years ago. Random loot works in ARPGs like Diablo and PoE because that's the whole point of the game to infinitely farm enemies to get loot. In CPRGs you not only cannot do that but its not the point of the game either, that is why actually good CPRGs like BG, Pathfinder games, and OG Bioware, Obsidian CRPGs have static loot. In this game RNG can just screw you being stuck for multiple levels without getting any good gear meaning you're gonna struggle.
- Encounter and enemy progression : Also really badly designed, there is no actual enemy scaling but there might as well be. This game is like made to screw you over. I was playing going full murderhobo doing all the quests and then killing all the NPCs for maximum XP and yet I could never outlevel the enemies, everywhere you go enemies are always either as high level or higher level than you. You can get off the boat in act 2 and be around level 8 or 9 yet the game makes you quickly face level 11 to 13 enemies that can kill your characters in 1-2 or 3 hits. Many times the games will do this and place really tough encounters in areas with easier ones meaning unless you follow a guide that will not do a linear progression of quests and encounters you will face unbeatable encounters for your level often so you have to reload and abandon them and go to other areas to scrounge up XP.

The ugly :

- Encounter design : This is actually the main reason I'm stopping playing the game, most encounters feel pretty much the same but that's the least of their problems. You basically have to prepare and heavily cheese every encounter and have prior knowledge of what's going to happen otherwise you will fail.
This means that basically you need to quicksave every 30 seconds in case something happens, then you let it happen, figure out how this encounter is gonna screw you over, and then reload to try to counter that, meaning you will be constantly quick saving and quick loading, it gets incredibly tedious.

I'm gonna draw a comparison to BG3, in BG3 there are a couple of ""Ambushes"" that you could fall into, but your characters actually get a perception check to detect the enemies and you can then turn the tables on them, enemies will also not basically 1 shot your characters. In DOS 2 you get constantly 1 or 2 shot, pretty much 1 encounter out of 2 is gonna be a random ambush where you advance into an area and enemies just magically jack-in-a-box appear out of nowhere and surround you immediately with no way from you to detect those enemies or prevent getting ambushed. Insanely dumb encounter design. And if you think we'll why don't you use the environment to your advantage, in tactical games you might think to use a chokepoint with a tank and keep your weaker characters behind out of danger. None of that works in this game because most enemies can instantly teleport anywhere and immediately appear on your wizard and pummel him to death in the same turn. So you're basically forced to just use cheese tactics like starting a conversation with the enemies and then while the conversation happens just switch to another character and teleport enemies far away from the others and kill them 1 by 1. 

Some times you can attack the other enemies outside the conversation and their boss will just stay in the conversation with your 1 character while you kill all his underlings, then you can heal up and take on the boss solo. Its just really stupid that they force people to cheese this way otherwise some fights are just impossible. I did the Aeterna fight last night and its one of the worst boss fights in the game, basically this boss will 100% kill your entire party easily if you even let them do anything, so again you are forced to cheese her and freeze her during the conversation, then just use a soul bond and cheese kill her drinking potions because she's and undead and takes damage from healing potions, boss fights should be fun and exciting. Boss fights in the pathfinder games and BG3 are fun. None of the boss fights in this game are fun, just insane high burst damage that will instantly kill you if you take any damage. Imagine playing Elden Ring like those guys that do a no damage run and they have to restart if they take a single hit, I mean sure some people might enjoy that but most people don't.",False

,147192619,"[h3] A Epic Journey Through Rivellon: Divinity Original Sin 2 Review [/h3]

[b] TDLR: [/b] Divinity Original Sin 2 is a monumental achievement in the RPG genre. With its unforgettable origin companions, masterful storytelling, and innovative game-play mechanics, it 100% helped to set a new  standard  of what an RPG can achieve - the path to BG3 if you will.  While the armor system may have its drawbacks, it's a small price to pay for the grand adventure that awaits in the world of Rivellon. Larian Studios crafted a masterpiece that will be remembered as a classic for generations to come.

Divinity Original Sin 2 should be - in my humble opinion - considered as one of the masterpieces in the realm of RPGs. It expertly weaves a tapestry of immersive storytelling and innovative gameplay that captivates from start to finish. 

For me the standout feature of DOS2 lies in its meticulously crafted origin companions. These characters are not just party members; they are fully fleshed-out personalities with rich backstories, motivations, and real connections to the world of Rivellon. Whether you're navigating the moral labyrinth with the conflicted Red Prince or delving into the dark depths of Fane's enigmatic past, each companion feels like a living, breathing entity, adding layers of complexity and emotional investment to the narrative.

The high-quality writing that underpins these characters is also very strong - you can in hindsight really see where they were heading narratively now we have had the pleasure of playing Baldur's gate 3. Larian Studios' attention to detail is evident in every line of dialogue and every piece of lore scattered throughout the world - I am obsessed with reading any book I can find in order to pick up another titbit of world building lore. The nuanced storytelling allows for meaningful interactions and choices that carry just enough weight, giving players a sense of agency rarely found in RPGs. The interwoven narratives of each origin companion and their personal quests provide a level of depth that is seldom achieved, making every decision feel impact-full and every revelation a momentous event.

Game-play in DOS2 is a testament to Larian Studios' commitment to innovation. The reactive surfaces system is a stroke of genius, introducing an element of tactical depth rarely seen in RPGs. The dynamic interplay of fire, water, poison, and electricity adds a layer of complexity to battles that demands strategic thinking and adaptability. This system elevates combat giving it a high level of tactical and strategical depth particularly on the more difficult modes, making each encounter a thrilling puzzle to solve.

The classless character system is a breath of fresh air, allowing players to craft their heroes with unparalleled freedom. This flexibility encourages experimentation and fosters a sense of ownership over your character's growth. I felt like the system really pushed me to create and try unique builds that suited varying play styles. This I think has helped my two two journeys through Rivellon so far have not ever felt the same.

However, one blemish for me on this otherwise almost flawless canvas is the armor system. While intended to add a tactical layer to battles, it can sometimes feel overly restrictive and lead to frustrating moments, particularly in the early stages of the game. It's a minor quibble in the grand scheme of things, but one that stands out in an otherwise seamless experience.

Definitely unlock the developers gift bag, at least the mirror, so you are able to change your characters and play around with different builds.  My favorite was act 2 and act 4, the end game.  There is a lot to do, the fights are mostly different each time, the enemies are smart, the environment can be against you, you need to think to survive. The story is very interesting, and not cheesy or linear.  I am hoping to see DOS 3 in future.  Definitely recommend this gem.",True

-The tutorial is tucked away and not in an obvious place
-Trading uses a slider instead of just typing the amount of gold you want to spend
-Your inventory gets moved around between the backpack and trade screens
-Your elemental spells will hit everybody: fire and ice everywhere
-There's a low-level shield throw skill that becomes insanely overpowered
-There's no reason for a necro to have more than 3 points in necro
-members of your party will disappear permanently if you don't complete their quest line before moving on to the next map
-If you move ahead too quickly, it will be much harder to find enough fights to level up on the next map
-You are told if you are blinded and cannot see a target but not told you your spell is targeting the banister of a stairwell and the the enemy you are trying to hit 
-In a turn-based game, some enemies have near infinite movement per turn
-Your party's movement outside of combat is probably the worst I've ever seen
--There is this chain/unchain system that switches states without you adjusting settings
--One character will enter a doorway and begin combat while the rest of the party sits outside out of combat
--Party members will not follow you across dangerous terrain, but the character you control will jump in lava to get to the place you clicked on another part of the map

[h2]Macbook Pro LAN Edition[/h2]

[b]Graphics:[/b]
While it may not fully harness the might of your Macbook Pro's stunning screen with HDR, Divinity: Original Sin 2 still manages to look impressive, like the gleaming surface of Tripticon. The game's attention to detail and intricate world design shine through, even without the full potential of your Mac's display.

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
As for the gameplay, it's like a Decepticon's strategy meeting—complex, engaging, and filled with unexpected twists. The LAN support, allowing you to join forces with Soundwave on his PC, is a testament to the versatility of your Mac. Cooperation between Mac and PC, now that's something Megatron himself would appreciate.

[b]Sound:[/b]
The game's audio, like a Decepticon's battle cry, immerses you in its fantasy world. The atmospheric music and voice acting add depth to your gaming experience.

[b]Performance:[/b]
It's unfortunate that HDR doesn't fully utilize your Mac's splendid screen. However, the fact that you can still enjoy this epic adventure on your Macbook Pro is a testament to its capabilities. It may not be Metroplex, but it gets the job done.

[spoiler]And remember, even if your Mac can't unleash its full potential with HDR, it's still a valuable asset in your gaming arsenal, much like a loyal Decepticon companion.[/spoiler]

In summary, Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition on your Macbook Pro is like a Decepticon adapting to new circumstances. It may not reach its full potential with HDR, but it's a commendable choice for LAN gaming with Soundwave and a testament to the versatility of your Mac.

,146942633,"This is the mixed bag of all mixed bags. 

The game has great art direction, graphics, music, voice acting, writing, lore, and character customization. But the entire game has one major, huge, tremendous, absurd flaw. 

Its combat.

In my opinion, this game has even worse combat than Divinity Original Sin 1. The problems in the first game are even worse here.

Enemies can still waltz through an entire screen's worth of oil, make a couple detours, and still have enough AP to attack your back line. And then steal your special spell casting resource, even if they don't have anyway to actually use it.

Just to annoy you. 

CC (Crowd Control) based combat is even more prevalent, but is even worse than the first game. Hypothetically, the armor mechanic in the game is supposed to protect both you and the enemies from being CC'd to death on the first turn. Not a bad thing, if the combat wasn't centered around the entire concept of ""you need to CC all enemies immediately or they will shove their boot up your backside"". However, the worst part is that the enemy will always go first, at least in any fight that actually matters. They'll immediately cast their strongest spell, wipe your your entire team's magic or physical armor, and then still have enough AP to follow up and stun your entire team. 

On top of that, most combat encounters are like clown cars. You'll see one enemy, or sometimes none, and then that one enemy will summon 5 friends outta nowhere. 

TL;DR: Decent game that's worth playing, but the combat is not worth respect. Cheese every encounter, its not worth your effort. 6.5 Outta ten

Got a feel for how the game operates and the story is addictive, along with the feeling of executing during battle. I've got so many hours in the game and I'm still in the middle of Act 2. 

You can save whenever so if you want a quick fix or a longer session, either is viable. Side quests are well done and fleshed out. Even though it's not all acted out like BG3 (it's more of a narrator describing things happening and you use your imagination to depict the details), the dialogue sequences give a variety of options on how you want to proceed (good, evil, sometimes good, neutral, selfish, selfless, etc.). I'm glad I came back and gave it another shot. 

If you have trouble at the beginning due to being new at this type of game, I'd suggest looking up general things on how it operates, and the type of ways you take advantage of different paths, It will get easier to understand the more you play, make mistakes, and learn from them. Great game overall.

If it was not for the Baldurs Gate title and Skills renamed to D&D and throwing a graphic D20 over the hidden roll that is in the other games it would be just Divinity 3 minus all the ridiculous sex with anything that has a hole that is in BG3 and all the real world LGBT bullshit that BG3 tries to push down your throat, also BG3 has effects and animations that are ripped right from Divinity 2 and some of the acts / story are very very similar to Divinity 2 and feels the same people who played Divinity 2 will know exactly what I'am talking about.

The only people that praise BG3 are the people that need to go touch grass and get laid that find a game like BG3 fun. BG3 is not a Baldurs Gate game and feels nothing like it or a D&D game just because you slap names from the D&D books on it does not make it one. 

Anyone who is a True D&D & Baldurs Gate fan should be ashamed of a game like BG3 using D&Ds popularity to cash in on its horny mess of a game.

And yes I bought BG3 on steam in early access and see that when it went full release they deleted all the negative reviews for the game and left the positive ones funny how that works. And yes I played BG3 most of the way through the full release just not on steam and was not going to pay for that garbage just to find out it was still a perverts rpg game.

,146563680,"I started playing DOS2 to get rid of that BG3 itch(if you know you know), so this review is for people like me who played BG3, loved it, and wanted to play something similar.

In my opinion, it's not even close to as good as BG3.  My two main issues: combat is stifling, and there is often a ""correct"" decision when talking to NPC's.

Combat: There is too much fire.  God forbid you want to play anything except a pyro tank, because you will encounter fire literally everywhere.  Good luck trying to spread any terrain effect around the battlefield when it'll be set on fire as soon as the enemy gets a turn.  Oh, did I mention literally every single enemy has fire scrolls?  You'll be in a fight with bandits near the beach and the field will be ablaze just as much as if you were fighting Hephaestus himself.  ""Just use rain,"" people will say.  Well, very early into the game you'll encounter necrofire, which can't be put out by water.  ""Just bless the fire and put it out,"" people will say.  Well, bless costs SP which isn't unlimited, and what's the point when the next enemy turn will just be oil + fire + curse?  Your only real solution is to embrace it and put fire resist on everyone, which is a pretty shitty solution if you ask me.

Add onto this the armor system.  In DOS2, physical and magical armor are separate.  You have to get through your respective armor before doing damage.  Let's say you invest 200 damage into breaking the physical armor of a boss.  Your mage is now essentially doing dogshit nothing because any damage they do will be blocked by the magic armor.  The game very much incentivizes you to play either full magic or full physical damage, which obviously isn't very fun for variation.  To add on to this, once armor is gone, CC works at 100%.  The game becomes very easy once you realize every fight is: pop one type of armor, CC lock the enemy.  If you don't do this, you can be sure as hell the enemy will.

Choices: I will admit that I like min-maxing; I often search up guides on what decisions will lead to what result, partially because I don't want to replay the game to see the other choices.  I would say in 90% of NPC interactions, there is an objectively ""best"" choice.  That is, there will be a choice that gives you the most EXP + rewards, and it won't be close.  You are strictly losing out on EXP + gear if you choose anything except these ""correct"" choices.  It really makes decisions feel inconsequential, because generally the best option is to choose the ""best"" choice and then do whatever it is you would've done(like kill the NPC).

To be fair to this game, if BG3 wasn't such a masterpiece I probably would've enjoyed DOS2.  It is, after all, made by the same studio.  If you are also looking at this game after playing BG3, I'd highly recommend looking up some DOS2 gameplay before committing to buying the game.  I strongly disagree with all of the reviews praising it as one of the best games of all time.  $45 is a large investment, and in my opinion it was not worth it.",False

,146560929,"Do you want to burn the entire battlefield with constant flames, or maybe throw a shield so hard that you concuss two guys at once? what about having such a high vamp and thorns rate that taking damage heals you? Maybe even talk to a cat that calls himself booply-bear, or arrange a date for a rat and a tortoise? 

Do any of those sound cool? play this game, and do all of them all.",True
,146558826,"This game is genuinely enjoyable and I think it's a must buy during steam sales. 

The combat system is really fun with everything being limited to your AP (Action Points) which range from attacks to just moving around in the process of a fight. Honestly while this may seem a little weird to point out but having the ability to move around while casting spells / attacking physically gives so much more freedom and strategy to play around with.
Even more, you can defeat enemies you weren't even supposed to fight if you play your fights really well. Being able to set up before a fight and making preparations which give you an edge over you enemy is so satisfying.

To make it even better, the amount of creativity this game gives you with your character is absolutely phenomenal. While you may not get to customize your looks as much as I would have hoped, there is just so much more you can tinker with when it comes to your abilities and stat line. For example, is it better to upgrade my thievery which gives me a chance to get hidden loot I never could have gained? Or should I focus on upgrading a combat ability which will allow me to more easily melt through enemies? There are benefits and downsides to both, but overall it's just a fun experience to mess around with and see what's optimal for your personal playstyle!",True
,131822065,"It's as good as everyone says. I wasn't sure I'd like this type of RPG but it's too good not to like. If you're on the fence, play it right now.

The amount of freedom in D:OS2 is astonishing. The way you progress, the way you interact with the world and its characters, and the way you build your own character, both in terms of roleplay and stats; it's all up to you. The fact that I could just kill off all the main characters at the beginning of the game just cause I felt like it... not many games let you do that.

Exploration is done incredibly well. Every discovery feels intentional and important, but at the same time, they're designed in a way that makes it really feel like a discovery. 

The voice acting is great, especially the animals. Take the Pet Pal trait. The writing, too, especially the way they describe magic, is great.

There were three main things that bothered me about D:OS2:
- It can be frustrating on occasion, especially the combat. The decay debuff makes me yell and say big cusses.
- Leveling can be a pain, and being underleveled sucks. It sometimes takes ages to get XP, and it seems like you have to do literally everything in the game if you want to be properly leveled for the ending on higher difficulties.
- The story can feel a little bit overcomplicated, messy, and unfocused at times. None of it detracted too much from the experience though.

I'll definitely be doing another playthrough. Probably two, or three, or four. Maybe five.

If you're coming from Dragon Age like I was: Dragon Age does a better job with its stories and companions in my opinion, and is meant to be more cinematic, but regarding everything else, D:OS2 leaves Dragon Age in the dust, and it still does a fine job with it's story and companions.",True

,148466116,"This game is a masterpiece. Like other Fromsoft titles, it can be brutally hard, but it does a very good job of giving you the tools to overcome those challenges, if you are willing to put in the time and experimentation to find them. Rather than an RPG where you steadily improve a single build over the course of a play-though, this game is all about finding many builds, whether specialist or generalist, and using them to address specific sets of problems. The different parts can impact each other (a core with boosts to reactor output can take a weaker generator with better combat stats and allow it to support a far heavier equipment load, for example) and parts which seem to have weaker performance statistics can have valuable benefits that are still worth including. Your speed, for instance, is influenced by three things: your overall weight, your core part's 'booster adjustment' stat, and the equipped booster. perhaps a slower booster with better vertical performance can be accounted for by keeping to the lighter parts elsewhere, to keep the speed high while enjoying the booster's other benefits. Every part feels like it has a place in at least one build, and tinkering to find new combinations and better understand their interactions is a big part of what I enjoy here. The ability to replay any story mission you've beaten is fantastic, not only because it'll give you a rating for completionists to maximize but because it'll pay out again so that early on you can pick up more part variety, and later on it'll let you go back and beat up on bosses who gave you trouble before you found the ideal tools to reduce them to metallic dust. The result is a game where the challenges feel great to interact with, because it's a matter of learning what strengths or skills will make addressing those challenges easier.

You can make the stupidest, most useless AC in existence and the game won't reprimand you for that or tell you what you should do instead. You learn everything on your own. Yeah, there's a tutorial, but it only gives you vague ideas of what you can do.
If you enjoy having freedom of choice in a very technical and demanding game, then yes I do recommend this game.

Enter AC6: Fires of Rubicon. I appreciate FromSoft finally throwing PC gamers a bone with recent games, rather than making us wait for half-assed ports, if any at all.

AC6 is pretty much what you'd expect from an AC game- large, destructive, quick moving mechs laying waste to everything in large, open environments. The controls are tight and responsive, the combat is fast paced, fun, and often challenging. Customizing and optimizing your AC can sometimes be fun.

I do have some criticisms, despite really enjoying the game.

Balance (as others have mentioned) could use a LOT of work. The vast majority of weapons become obsolete very quickly. One of the reasons for this is the Stagger mechanic. Once you get weapons that do high Impact damage, there isn't much reason to use anything else, leaving you with a long list of weapons that you'll never use. The biggest casualty of the Stagger bar are fast, lightweight builds, as there aren't any decent weapons that your mech can carry to put high strain on enemy ACS. You'll be using Bazookas, Heavy Missile launchers, Laser Cannons, Grenade Launchers, or the Zimmerman, and that's about it, so you're pretty much left with Medium-Heavy to Heavyweight builds if you actually want to be effective.

Rather than nerfing the powerful weapons (they SHOULD be powerful), I'd like to see them buff the weaker, lower impact weapons to make lightweight builds more viable. Some of us like piloting fast mechs, but don't want to rely on just melee to build ACS Strain.

Mission balance is another issue. You'll breeze through a lot of missions with little to no challenge, and then BOOM...in comes the infamous FromSoft Sadism. You'll be stuck retrying a boss or rebuilding your AC over and over before you finally take down certain bosses. Looking at you Balteus and Sea Spider.

All in all though, AC6 is a fun game, the graphics are great, the performance is great, and the bugs are minimal. I'm certainly glad that FromSoft is releasing complete games, even if they need some fine tuning.",True

,148453620,love the game,True
,146804719,"you may have heard people saying that fromsoftware should add an easy mode to the game and felt offended by the idea. heres the thing tho. they did. its called zimmermann and pilebunker mode. having trouble with the hardest bosses in the game? go pew pew and then pointy stick. you win every single time. but what about pvp you ask? yes, zimmermann and pointy stick makes it easy too, unless theyre going with a bumblebee build to directly counter it. fromsoftware truly cares about everyone
besides that, great game. rusty is best boy

on a more serious note, yes, this is a great game. art direction? hell yeah. this world is a bleak distopia and it shows tho it always feels a bit silly how this world is made for ACs. its huge. gigantic.

the music is pretty gucci. some of the tracks are fine and get the job done but good lord some of them are bangers

 combat is fun, simple to understand but with a high skill cealing. a good player will trivialise any boss regardless of their build but like i said, some builds will make the game very easy.  the missions surprisingly dont feel like rinse and repeat. theres ONE stealth mission and it fits, awkwardly, in the game. theres ONE escort mission. despite the game having only so many mechanics, no mission feels the same. thats quite the flex imo. if youre familiar with fromsoftware, you know the bosses will suplex you. a lot of new people who came into this game blind were, as we say, filtered. if you got filtered by balteus, i understand. you got filted by the tutorial boss? thats embarrassing...anyways! the boss fights are pretty neat! some a gimics and others are just straight up duals but some are harder than others. the final boss in the *happy* ending was a joke. i beat them on my first try but i was beaten emotionally. they broke my emotional ACS and landed a direct hit into my tear ducts. i assure you, if you keep trying to learn their pattern and youre willing to customize your mech, you will win. theres plenty of busted builds out there for you to copy and trivialise the game with anyways. beating these bosses is an achievement and you will very likely become good enough to farm them for money and trying out builds. theres a mission where the clock is ticking for you to defeat two high level opponents before a third one joins the fray. my build was way too slow to beat them so i changed his guns. the mission went from wanting to tear my hair out to a cakewalk. it wasnt a broken build in any shape or form. i choose a different assault rifle and it changed everything. thats it. assault rifles arent even powerful in this game for some reason. the burst fire one is pretty gucci but my point stands

ONE OF THE BEST THINGS ABOUT THIS GAME IS THE CHECKPOINTS! 
the reason why i lose my mind with darksouls is having to get back to the boss. its torture. this game, has none of that garbage. you die to a boss? THE CHECKPOINT GETS YOU RIGHT BACK INTO THE ARENA HELL YEAH BROTHER! also you get a full restore so that helps makes the game easier and before you complain that this will make the game too easy, you cannot get a perfect score if you use a checkpoint. the full restore is essential for the skill challenged ones of us who play this game, including me but eh at least im not a meta slave

you may hear some complaints once in a while about the game not having a story but thats coming from people who need to be spoonfed everything. the story is solid as you would expect from a fromsoftware game and as cryptic as one. well, its not really that criptic but some details may fly under the radar if you arent actively listening. the third ending will likely confuse you so just look up a lore video like every fromstoftware fan will do in their free time anyways. this game plays way smoother than it should. the characters in this game are great and just like everyone and there mother will mention, are compelling even tho you never once see their face. i cant really think of a single character i didnt like. even the characters youre supposed to not like, SNAIL, are good characters. one moment im playing a game about big robots going pew pew haha stuneedle goes brrr and the next im crying on my first play through, ugly crying the words ''f-fl-fly high bu-buddyyy! I love you!''. the voice acting in this game is stellar. the story would feel so much weaker if these characters didnt have such clean performances.

ive maybe seen one single bug? a boss used a specific attack that collided me straight into me but for some reason i didnt get hurt. it was a direct hit and she dragged me for a bit but nada. i was fine.
 
you get a lot of pieces to build your very own mech and the paintjob system is *chefkiss*. i do feel like a lot of the pieces are just extra variations of missiles and maybe theres a bit too many and we could use more variaty instead in other departments? maybe its just me but i feel like theres a bit too many missiles and a lack of other stuff. im pretty happy with most of the mechs i built and i think they got some good style as well. as a fromsoftware fan, fashion is a must. they all feel distinct and like MY creations. a really neat detail i must share is that everything you see in the trailer is in the game. all the frame pieces, the weapons, the ennemies. its all in it. yes, you can use that really cool bomb satchell! i like to call it the chinese pocket sand. the chinese weapons are blunt but a lot of fun to use and thats coming from a dex scum

 pvp is pretty alright. the matchmaking system is pretty barebone but the gameplay is worth it.

 im sleep deprived and depressed so im not able to express myself as fully as id like to but hopefully i managed to convince you this game is worth your time regardless if you are a fromsoftware fan or not.",True

,145157248,"PvP is garbage either due to the way you connect to opponents (inconsistent with what is being displayed to each player) or just the way they designed the game. #1 people can kick you when they are no where near you. I've often had people kick me when there was a 50 ft gap between us or speed their AC up when they kick, beyond what their AC can achieve with assault boost #2 The guns have inconsistent fire rates in some matches. Sometimes my gun wont even fire until 2-3 seconds after I've hit the mouse button, other times they work flawlessly  #3 Stun locking is on another level, what skill does it take to cycle through 3 attacks that keep people frozen. Needs a serious debuff, same with this new stagger system, that also needs a debuff. It limits the AC builds that require actual skill. #4 Your gun will make the noise and show the animation of you firing but if you get staggered before your bullet makes contact with the enemy then your bullet magically disappears and does no damage #5 Sometimes when quick boosting sideways the enemies bullets will turn at you and follow you as if they were homing missiles. #6 Again with the kicking... you can just keep tapping the assault boost button on players and in some cases just kick the other player to death and they can't even move? #7 The fact your AC gets showcased to your opponent before every match like you invited them over for tea and crumpets. LAME. #8 Full charged weapon builds need to get overloaded longer after firing all guns on charged. Pretty cheap way to win a lot of matches. Spam charged weapons, if you hit the enemy with one barrage they die. barely even have to move around. Lots to fix with PvP. I can win 20 matches in a row and still be mad and disappointed. Some of the stuff is just painful to watch unfold and leaves me saying ""okay now that's just cheap"" even when it's me doing it. Definitely takes away from the satisfaction of killing someone when you're getting stressed out from phantom kicks and homing bullet. Fortunately the single player is good. Very fluid and haven't noticed any ridiculous things like I see in multiplayer. The campaign is okay if you like new game + play style. I would prefer to get my story line in one play through and not have them make you start a new game over and over just to add a few missions until you finally figure out whats actually happening. In its current state I can't recommend the game. If you have the extra money go ahead, it's not a horrible game and can be fun. But if it's between this or another game.

One major issue is the easy anti cheat, with it my fps constantly fluctuates and has micro stutters. The worst part that forced me to disable EAC and mostly play offline was the fight against the honest fellow who was a brute. Every time I looked at the light source in the arena my frames dropped dramatically to what felt like 10 fps. After disabling it, near solid 60 fps.

With that out of the way, although tough, it is a fair game with a cool art style, plenty of customisation and a nice, thoughtful, and not too long story. A definite 8 out of 10. 
The intrusive anti cheat that kills frames really sucks that it forces a decision between stability or multiplayer, but since the singleplayer and personal approach is the main draw, I think its definitely worth the asking price.

The graphics aren't the highest quality, but the art direction more than makes up for it, setting the mood for every level, while maintaining visual clarity.

Update:
5th playthrough. I completed each and every part. There's a lot to choose from. But if you experienced playing the previous titles like Last Raven, this is only 30% of the total parts that can be unlocked and bought in that game. I hope we can have more parts, arena mode ranking system with even more, harder AI competitors, and missions. PVP is there but is not the main focus of the game. AC has always been enjoyed in your lonesome.

7th playthrough and I completed all of the achievements. Manual aim helped in S ranking the Ice Worm, which was the last mission that I had trouble getting S ranked.

This game goes out of its way to make YOU feel like the BEST pilot in Armored Core 6 all with the dialogue, the music, and the challenging fights coming together to make a wonderful whole. This game had me moving in my seat to dodge attacks in game! It's been a good minute since a game has made me do that. This is one of the first times I've seen a 3D Bullet-Hell done right. 

The deep customization for your personal mech is one of the defining features of the Armored Core franchise and I'm glad to see that the customization has not been skimped on in any sense of the word. You can create your own emblems COD BLACK OPS style and even put them onto your AC to make the color palettes a bit more intricate than the standard color selection. Customization allows you to think outside of the box to personalize your AC to make you feel like you're actually part of the story. Another well done self insert character.

The story takes many twists and turns with different routes making replaying the game all that much more rewarding. Each choice giving you basically a completely different end-game. The characters were also pretty good. They're voiced really well and that's basically necessary because all of the characters are faceless, hidden behind their AC/ Emblem. That isn't a bad thing though. I believe that this game uses that to it's advantage because the game is ALL about the ARMORED CORE. You can often see the personalities of the characters reflected off of their AC builds even once you unlock them in the arena. This game much like many FROMSOFT games have many different attention-to-detail things that make their games feel extremely immersive no matter how they present the story. 

The multiplayer is a nice addition, seeing all the other players builds and fighting against them is basically the heart and soul of the AC community. It's all great fun.

This latest entry in the long line of Armored Core games reached my expectations and then some. Whether you are completely new to the series, or are a returning vet, Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is an excellent game for everyone with its comparatively easier learning curve, compared to previous entries, and its excellent overall game feel.

The story is a natural evolution of how previous Armored Core games handled it, with the main focus being on getting into the action and utilizing your own custom mech. Speaking of, the customization is absolutely bonkers and people who like to make their own ""character"" or customize things in games won't be disappointed.

The multiplayer is pretty light and you don't unlock it until around the midway point of a single run of the story. It consists of only a 1v1 and team deathmatch mode, but is still pretty smooth and enjoyable.

The one big downside/hope I have when it comes to this game is that I wish they would update the multiplayer to have more content and replayability as it can sometimes get stale fighting other players in basic arenas over and over. Even something like a co-op mode or a bigger variety of pvp modes would be nice.

,145715776,"Sooo. My relations with this game are .... complicated

Let's start with pros:
- the game is great
- gameplay is VERY cinematic and engaging
- the lore is nice
- that feel of being a pilot of a BIG MECH WITH GUNS - it is there, boys. It is right there
- AC bosses are very interesting to fight against

But here they are, non-AC bosses VS my lightweight build:
- 10 faster than you
- 10 more health and stagger meter
- no cooldowns
- input reads
- takes 60% of your health in one attack
- that hits back to back thx to RNG
- the area is a small square with nowhere to hide and breath
- so, eat cheap damage/stagger ALL THE TIME
- camera WILL screw you
- your bullets ricochet but their NEVER (be closer -> eat more chip damage)
- take your light AC+blade+shield and shove it into your own A$$ since it is TANK LEGS + GATLING GUN META
- cheese is the only way here
- or invest 2h+ into fight untill you win just because of statistics
- WTF would AC even exist in this world, when these monsters are lurking around? Lore? Please?

Solution (and advice for newbies): not everything works against Non-AC bosses. Deal with it. But to reduce the amount of frustration: you should have 2 builds ready for every mission: kinetic/missiles for high stagger, and energy for high dps. Once you die - you can change your build. USE IT

The game plus non-AC bosses - 10 lazzzer blades out of 10
Non-AC bosses - ""meh"" every single one of them",True
,148344426,"honestly, i never played an ac game before this game, but this game made me wanna take a deep dive into the lore and the old games of armored core.

do not be afraid my fellow gamers, this is the most casual game that fromsoft ever made, easier than Déraciné (fs VR game) and here's why:

- pretty short game (25ish hours)
- easier to change your build and farming credits
- Nothing is lost when you died
- most of the checkpoint is before fighting hard enemies or hard section
- a lot of cannon fodder enemies
- you can paint your death machine whatever you like
- there's lady in my head callin me stud muffin
- strong early weapon; plasma blade is strong, right? :)

This game goes straight into my all-time favorite games and will probably stay there for a really long time. It has its flaws, primarily the balancing, but with the constant patches they are managing to adjust the balance. it is an incredible step up from its predecessors, and in the landscape of mecha games I am hard pressed to find anything that comes close. I recommend it to any lover of the genre and in general it is a solid product that I recommend to many.

Brief Review
Solid 8/10 game, story is lacking, which is to be expected from a fromsoft game. The gameplay is amazing. There is online PVP, however there is a constant meta that takes away from trying out other builds for your mech. Took me about 17 hours to complete the story, which includes a short amount of time in PVP.  Additionally the game encourages at least three play throughs to get the ""true"" ending. ",True

   Armored Core 6 is one of my favorites of the series. I still hold 4 and 4a to my first and second spot but this is easily becoming my favorite. maybe its the 9 year wait. maybe its my love for the From Soft library at this point. Armored core 6 is a graphically stunning and overall great time. I can say if you are a hardcore fan of the games prior to 4 you may find the difficulty lacking as the game is nowhere close to being as punishing for mistakes. But, it is a great installment none the less that I wholeheartedly endorse.  It is worth the buy and the hours you will put into it.",True

,148312805,"I love this game. I bought this specifically to reminisce on my youth as I played AC3 as a child. Glad to see it has only improved from a mechanical standpoint; no pun intended. Now's a good time to mention my comma key is not working so I am using semi-colons to compensate.

I have a few issues with the game and they are as follows.
1 - My main problem right now is the sound cutting out. It's maddening; so much so that I actually resorted to listening to something else to confirm it's just the game doing it; but I have no way to fix it. It's a real issue given that the story is told via sound; I have subs on so I circumvented that; but also that you have audio/visual cue's to respond. If I don't have audio; I cannot which forces the difficulty forward.
2 - While I like the ""Every gun fits"" mentality; I wish there were more times where a gun does not fit; and where a build does not work. I also wish there was more visibility on replaying missions to earn credits as I only found that out after at least a quarter of the game being played.
3 - Patterns / aesthetics. The first 2 were major issues; this is minor. However; I would like to see more customization within the unit itself. I like how mine looks; but I know it could look better.
4 - Voice lines. Not sure how this passed dev; at one point someone says ""this is the biggest pain in the ass"" which felt like the most genuine voice line of the entire game. Everything else was a wash; I would rather them just say ""this is what you need to focus on""; feels like a lot of half-baked speculation on the voice lines that are there; also; you suddenly go from no one to someone; and the game doesn't do well about telling you that. Or maybe my sound skipped so much I missed it; tough to tell. FYI this happens even after verifying my files.
5 - Versatility/Variety. I wanted to make a spider mech. I genuinely launched the game and said ""today's the day; spider mech is comin'"" I can't do that though. The bosses can; however I cannot. Big bummer; the options make sense however are few in number.. opportunity is high here.

Overall the game is nice; I really wish I didn't have sound skips that for whatever reason occurred later on; outside of that I have played every chance I get this week. I feel this game/series could be expanded on a lot more and I hope the developers take a hard look at their opportunity here. they could make over-heads that have similar features that would be successful at a fraction of the cost/labor to produce. I would easily pick up an X-Com similar Armored Core game. If they are dead-set on having a FPS Mech game than the details should not be overlooked as they have a monopoly on this currently that many have left behind.",True

The story itself surprising has layers to it giving narrative decisions and cut-scenes that feel compelling. Multiplayer is alright with the Team and Single pvp mode, but I was hoping they would do more, for example some objective modes maybe even coop. There are Meta builds, but its really not that bad along that you understand your build and your opponents its really down to ones skill and cunning honestly.

The feeling of getting sick and tired of dying over and over again, I finally got over it.

I have finished the game 3 times and I can actually see a beautiful learning curve of myself.

> 1st playthrough : 62 hours (possibly 150+ deaths) (1 good ending)

> 2nd playthough (fresh start) : 26 hours (less than 45 deaths) (other 2 good endings)
> 3rd playthrough (NG+) : 11 hours (less than 15 deaths) (bad ending)

after 1.5 years...
> 4th playthrough (NG+2 + DEMON BELL) : 15 hours (exactly 30 deaths) All mini bosses, hidden bosses and dragon return ending.

This game became one of my most hated titles to one of the most loved titles. And this is much like my DOOM ETERNAL experience. It's not about story at all, it's all about gameplay. The fact that first I thought prosthetic is so confusing and poorly designed TO using prosthetic to their limits to beat everybody TO bring down every enemy using only my sword, shows that every aspect of this game is so well constructed. Everything seems partly useful to completely match winner at the same time. Everything creates a perfect balance to cruise your way across the game.

To even think that I was the biggest hater of souls-type game and where I stand now... It is borderline unbelievable for me to think. In past 2 months I have crammed so many hours into this game and I don't regret a single second of it, not anymore.

HUGE RESPECT to FROM SOFT STUDIOS.",True

Four playthroughs later I can honestly say that this is one of the best games I've ever played. I've played Nioh, Elden Ring, and plenty of other RPGs before Sekiro, but Sekiro just clicked with me in a completely different way. Artistically the game is breathtaking but the main highlight is the combat mechanics. Many RPGs give you a lot of flexibility with how you can approach combat, but Sekiro is more linear. Instead of drowning you in loot, there's more of an emphasis on improving your ability to use what you already have. You still get consumables and allocate skill points to obtain different passive and non-passive abilities, but success is really measured by your ability to parry precisely (not just block), strike sparingly when it really counts, and manage your posture. This creates a more focused experience where you're forced to consistently be aggressive and engaged. You'll often be punished for tip-toeing around and playing it safe. Ultimately this makes for a more rewarding experience and I found myself going back time and time again. If you have the patience to push through and give it a fair shake, it's worth it.",True

Graphics: tbh mid capped at 60 FPS 
Fighting mechanics: hehe, parry parry parry hit , parry parry (yes, I have skills). 2/10 
Playstyle variety: 0/10 
Quality of bosses: 5/10. You will face absolute pushovers. 
With this game FS decided to solve the problems they created just for the sake of creating them. 
It is definitely not a starter game for anyone who wants to get into soulsbornes. 
It is definitely not a game for anyone who likes soulbornes. 
It is definitely alternative for BDSM chamber torture you would suffer from while playing Nioh and Nioh2. 
Take care gamers.

my personal favorite.
even after ~500 hours, [i]Sekiro[/i] remains evergreen.

[i]Sekiro[/i] boasts stellar combat with near-infinite depth.
ridiculously precise hitboxes, open-ended movement, and the focused design of its limited scope, leads to a wealth of advanced tech.
feels like every time i play this game, i learn something new.

the game is [i]almost[/i] perfectly balanced imo.
having to purchase Spirit Emblems is asinine, i don't think Combat Arts should cost Spirit Emblems to use, and some Prosthetics are a little too expensive per use.
but those are relatively minor balancing nitpicks, easily fixed with mods. the core game mechanics are extremely polished.

the story/lore of this game isn't quite as detailed as the Soulsborne titles, but it still boasts some evocative character moments.

It isn't hard to learn at all, just takes time to master, and once mastered it's extremely satisfying. You also get a sense of accomplishment when beating bosses and overcoming challenges. The game doesn't play itself you're the one playing, and honestly being op and one shotting everything or having a summon to help you with the fights would make for a very boring experience.
Also this was hands down the coolest story in Souls.

block should not cancel into itself, especially if that parry window is gonna be so lenient - once you get into the flow of it, the majority of the bosses are not all that difficult. 

another large complaint is the arms - i like maybe half of them and the rest are either niche or outright lame. why was the whistle not just the default in lieu of those stupid ceramic shards? some really dumb stuff with their lack of utility and how the upgrades work. lies of p does this SIGNIFICANTLY better.

Undoubtly, Sekiro is FromSoftware's most difficult and most boring game. Difficult, because attacks hit hard, healing is very limited and grinding is no option. Boring, because the lack of build variety means every fight feels the same and the world itself is uninteresting.

Closing statement: Sekiro has 95% positive reviews, but 51% haven't beaten more than 1 full-fledged boss. I agree with the 51%, who stopped playing for good reasons.


EDIT: 29/34
Follow a guide to not miss upgrades. Early-game is tedious. End of mid-game feels balanced. Don't believe anyone that you have to git gud to beat Sekiro. Many enemies can be spam deflected, spam attacked or cheesed, even some full-fledged bosses. At least, Sekiro is fun for achievement hunters.

On top of that, blatant cheating with spinbots isnt even rated as cheating anymore when you rate a match at overwatch, so dont waste your time thinking you help the community.

I really liked playing CSGO even though i know not good but i used to know why I lost. But constly being hit thorugh walls and smoke on the first shot at every angle, every replay being corrupted and the overwatch system not working anymore (used to be ealier) just skip it.

The point in CSGO was a rewarding match system but its gone.

While most people enjoy games that don’t require much skill, filled with too many abilities, rocket launchers, and spikes, I enjoy a game called Counter-Strike 2.

While most people think that CS2 is a downgrade from CS:GO, with people missing headshots and dying behind walls, I believe that you would have missed them anyway in CS:GO and that CS2 is the best thing that Valve has made since the Level 2 2022 Service Medal.

,34812865,"Too many cheaters and the developers aren't doing anything effective.

It's not a bad game but the garbage cheater-filled playerbase is what makes it bad. Don't waste your money on this game until something is done about cheaters.

UPDATE 21 NOVEMBER 2017: More cheaters than before, but at least we have new skins and rank emblems!

UPDATE 26 JUNE 2019: CS:GO is free to play now. There are even more cheaters than before. We have even more skins and ranks are even more messed up now.

UPDATE 5 FEBRUARY 2021: FACEIT Premium and ESEA has more ""legit cheaters"" than ranked matchmaking, which is hilarious. The anticheat in the game has gotten better, but there are still cheaters in about half the matches I play, sometimes less, sometimes more. Skins have taken over the game basically. Because of the high skin activity, the inventory servers are down very often. I still love this game, but until the cheater problem is dealt with, I can't give it a positive rating.

UPDATE 29 OCTOBER 2021: Still full of cheaters. Exceedingly rare to get a match without at least one. I think nothing will ever be done. Counter-Strike is THE best competitive shooter out there, but it's dying. The only part of this game that's still relatively alive is e-sports, and even there cheaters sometimes pop up. If an invasive anti-cheat were introduced, I would play this non-stop. Don't waste your money on this game, whether it's on Prime or on skins. Skins are used for money laundering.

UPDATE 14 NOVEMBER 2021: Multiple cheaters in every single ranked match. I'm parting ways with this game. I never wanted to leave, but it's unplayable. 10 years since release, and we still have this problem. Unacceptable.

UPDATE 18 MAY 2023: Still cheaters. Screw this game.

Just orchestral ambient sound like every other indie/western developed game! The graphics and aesthetics are terrible. Sprites and backgrounds are incredibly basic, while modern bloom and other lighting techniques are applied to pour excrement onto the already mediocre graphics, making the overall presentation nauseating. The environments themselves are also poorly designed and entirely unmemorable. The gameplay has the potential to be good, like the variety of weapons at your disposal. Unfortunately this game controls like Wayne's World on SNES. I'm not one to complain about short games, but I reached the ending of this in a mere 2 hours. Nothing compared to the intricately designed maps featured in the Castlevania games, which feature true exploration and puzzles. At the end of the day this game is just a shallow imitation of the Castlevania games released on the GBA/DS. Do yourself a favor and play those, and stay far away from this game.",False

If you only have $10 and plan to spend the rest of your time playing a repetitive, unbalanced, not-even-Metroidvania, this is the game for you.

Yes, you'll be using the wiki quite a bit, it doesn't help anyway. There are very clear build paths that you're supposed to happen upon without help in blind a blind 'playthrough.'. 

The item descriptions don't make any sense in regards to synergy or how they're supposed to work half the time.

The worst part, is that you'll be spending hours getting to the same area you were before just for 3 minutes of new content and unless you lucked your way into a nice build, you'll be spending another hour to get there.

I do not recommend it for its end game difficulty increase modes since it puts too much of an emphasis on playing perfectly with its ever so dwindling supply of health potions for the entire run, and getting rid of ways to restore your health after boss fights, which is made more punishing by there being a chance of getting weapons that are too weak to do the later parts of the run and thus making fights lasting longer than it should.

,145896766,"This game changed how I viewed a whole genre... Was always nervous to try out playing any Rogue-lite/like games because the thought of dying and losing all progress seemed like the complete opposite of what fun sounds like to me. My only experience was that I tried Binding of Isaac and thought it was okay. Then one day I was hanging out at a friend's place and she asked me to try it out, I sucked pretty bad but I liked the movement and combat. It didn't matter that I died though because it wasn't my file, so I tried a few more runs and thought it was neat that you didn't actually lose everything. Then I got home and had the urge to try it again but had to wait until I visited again. I played it a couple more times over there and each time I left I wanted to play more but didn't want to wait until I was over at their place again so I eventually bit the bullet and bought it for myself. At first I thought I wasn't gonna have as much fun since I had to start from square one, then I played it and time and progression flew by quick! This has become one of those games where I can keep going back to time and time again and start playing whenever I have nothing else to play. Basically everything about it is great from art direction to controlling your character and even the option to make it easier or harder if you want. I ended up buying all of the DLCs which I think says something for a game I was hesitant about getting in the first place.

,148755323,"At this point, there should be no doubt that this game is a triumph. FromSoftware pulled out all the stops for this one, and it shows. 

Every time I boot up the game, I feel as if I have been pulled into a deeply deranged dream. The Lands Between are gorgeous, meticulously crafted by careful hands that understand what makes human beings want to push further into the unknown. 

At first, I was skeptical about the shift to an open world. Having played through Dark Souls II and III, I knew that tightly planned levels were FromSoftware's bread and butter. Would the existential claustrophobia of being trapped in a twisted nightmare come through if I were gifted a horse along with the ""if you see it, you can go there"" concept? 

In the end, the freedom I was given actually contributed to my sense of despair. It enabled me to lose myself in the Lands Between, stumble into places before I ""should"" have gotten there. I was pleasantly surprised to find many closed dungeons within the vastness. Oftentimes, this game felt like a good book, as all I needed to do to feel as if I had been transported inside is give my undivided attention. 

FromSoftware has implemented some new mechanics, including respawn points near bosses and crafting. Getting PvP invasions while playing solo and durability are gone. One of the most important changes is the invention of spirit ashes, which allow regular AI summons. Personally, I did not use them much because they can trivialize the game, but I understand why someone new to this type of game might want to have them. The problem is that a lot of encounters feel balanced around your ability to summon spirit ashes, so if you are someone who wants to avoid using them altogether your playthrough is going to be more difficult and a good chunk of your exploration will be functionally useless because the rewards along the way are often upgrade materials for spirit ashes or spirit ashes themselves. 

I also feel like melee-only builds are at a huge disadvantage in this game, as fighting from range is much safer. The enemy AI is not that sophisticated, so even just having a few throwing knives to lead enemies away from a larger group allows for easy mode. Once enemies are in melee range, being able to stance-break them makes all the difference because it allows for critical hits. There is no indicator for how close you are to achieving this, so a lot of the time you just have to hope that you will get lucky. Over time, I got a sense of how to get consistent stance-breaks with my particular build, but it was not easy to build this intuition at all and it still felt inconsistent sometimes. Of course, this mechanic existed in previous Souls titles, but I relied on it a lot more for this game because it was much easier to do and more important than ever given the faster combat.

This is not a perfect game, but it is up there. Elden Ring is more repetitive than previous Souls titles and does not feel rough around the edges, but going through a complete playthrough of this game is an experience that will transport you somewhere else if you allow it to.",True

The bosses are just difficult enough that you are extremely excited when you finally overcome the challenge, but not difficult enough that you dislike the fight (Yes I mean Malenia and spoiler boss). The exploration is amazing, because most POIs you need to get to are visible on the map. This brings the challenge of exploration from the process of searching every nook and cranny for something (cough cough, totk, cough, cough) to figuring out how to get to a location. Usually in the process of getting to the poi, you end up finding caves filled with goodies or NPCs with long rewarding questlines to fufill.

,116908056,"Elden Ring, the latest creation from the masochistic minds at FromSoftware, is here to make you question your life choices and laugh like a lunatic while doing it. As a player who's endured countless ""You Died"" screens.

Gameplay (11/10 - Seriously):
If you thought Dark Souls was challenging, Elden Ring is here to remind you that you're not even in the same league. It's like FromSoftware gathered all the game testers in the world, locked them in a room, and said, ""Let's make this harder!"" The joke's on you, though, because there's something oddly satisfying about dying over and over again. It's like a Dark Souls-themed stand-up comedy show where the punchline is always ""You Died.""

World Design (9/10):
The open-world concept is fantastic. The world is so interconnected that sometimes you'll find shortcuts that make you feel like a genius and other times, you'll get lost and ponder the meaning of life. It's like a never-ending maze, and the devs are the maze masters, cackling as they watch you wander around aimlessly.

Storytelling (8/10):
The storytelling in Elden Ring is like that cryptic inside joke you just can't seem to get. George R.R. Martin and Hidetaka Miyazaki must have had a blast conspiring to confuse players. They sprinkle hints here and there, but it's as if they're saying, ""You'll never guess the ending."" So, you just go with it, accepting that you're clueless in a beautifully crafted and confusing world.

Graphics and Sound (10/10):
Elden Ring is a visual and auditory feast, but sometimes it's so good that you forget to dodge incoming attacks. It's like a beautiful distraction from the impending doom that surrounds you. The landscapes are breathtaking, the lighting is glorious, and the enemies look like they just walked out of your worst nightmare. The hauntingly good soundtrack only makes it better – it's like an eerie lullaby that makes you feel right at home in a world where death is your neighbor.

Technical Performance (7/10):
Occasionally, the game stutters or glitches, as if it's trying to be funny. It's like the game itself is a stand-up comedian who's a little tipsy on performance-enhancing estus flasks. But it's nothing game-breaking, just minor inconveniences that add to the quirky charm.

Multiplayer (10/10):
Co-op play and invasions are where Elden Ring really shines in the humor department. You can summon a friend to help you with a boss, and they'll probably die in the first five seconds, giving you a good laugh. Or you can invade someone else's world and scare the living daylights out of them as they scramble for safety. It's a multiplayer comedy show, and you're the star.

In conclusion, Elden Ring is a game that doesn't just challenge your skills but your sanity as well. It's a rollercoaster of death and laughs, a mix of despair and delight. If you're willing to embrace the absurdity of it all, it's a hilarious adventure that you won't forget. Just don't take it too seriously, or you'll end up crying in a corner, surrounded by your virtual corpses.

The game will keep you on your toes when delving into any of the hundreds of dungeons, tons of hidden areas in plain sight, you will find new items, bosses, dungeons, quests or lore that you missed in each new play through!

       The game does not hold your hand, has no linear progression, not very straight forward, if you want to learn about the story, or even know which way to go next to progress, you have to figure it out. There is no quest log for you to check what's left to do in the game, or to remind you about that one npc that asked you to do something and you forgot where the npc was, a few days later.

        This game is a masterpiece even tho it can be pretty fokkin hard at times, that being said, I just want to add that if your definition of ""having fun"" in a game is not dying and being called ""champion"" every time your character wipes their ass, this game is not for you. If dying gives you IRL ptsd and makes you feel like a failure, this game is not for you. In Elden Ring you try stuff, die, learn from that and we GO AGANE!

For example you can summon spirits to fight along side you and pull aggro from bosses to give the player extra time to heal/buff/ or create an opening for attack.  Most of the best summons once upgraded can solo many of the bosses.  Also most bosses have a ""cheese"" strategy which makes it possible for lower skill players have an edge; i.e. the Godskin Duo (one of the toughest bosses in the game) can be trivialized by crafting sleep pots and smacking them while they're asleep.",True

Martin's world-building expertise. The result is nothing short of breathtaking. The combat betrays the classic Dark Souls mechanics, with new and cleaner sword art and animations. It feels a lot smoother and fluid than older dark souls games. If you're a huge fan of FromSoftware's storytelling, you will be rewarded with possibly the most intricate and captivating lore. Highly recommend binge watching VaatiVidya's Prepare to Cry Playlist of Elden Ring, to connect deeply with this game.

The meta-difficulty of the Dark Souls games is reduced. Resources for adventuring can be found. Instructions can be found. Falling after crossing a LOT of terrain... not an issue.
The annoyances are reduced but the difficulty is there.
If you don't want to practice with a difficult boss for hours - go multiplayer and have some veterans do it for you!

It's a bit less morbid and depressing than Dark Souls.
I've expected WAY more novelty and bigger differences.
Nope. This is a Dark Souls sequel with some variations, but way more fidelity.

Complaints?
1. Tanking isn't as viable as I'd like it to be.
2. Most tough enemies just require you to dodge a LOT through plenty of combos so you can grab that ONE quick attack and wait for another combo to get depleted. It gets tedious.
3. There's way less ad hoc solutions for tough enemies and bosses than there was in Dark Souls 1.
4. There's more repetition of enemies than with traditional Dark Souls.

Elden Ring is like a long-anticipated reunion with an old friend you've missed dearly. FromSoftware and George R.R. Martin have delivered something truly exceptional.

The gameplay is quintessential FromSoftware, maintaining the brutal and rewarding combat mechanics that fans adore. Yet, the open-world element adds a new layer of freedom and adventure. Riding your trusty steed through the vast, eerie, and fantastical world of the Lands Between is a revelation.

The story and world-building are engrossing. Martin's touch is evident in the rich lore that unfolds in a non-linear, cryptic manner. The world is a tapestry of intriguing factions and demigods, each with their own history and motivations.

Visually, Elden Ring is a masterpiece. The graphics are top-notch, and the art design is hauntingly beautiful. Exploring this dark, dynamic world with its changing weather and day-night cycle is an immersive experience.

The sound design and music further elevate the game. The ambient sounds, the clatter of horse hooves, and the ominous background tunes all contribute to a deeply atmospheric experience.

In short, Elden Ring is a dark fantasy gem. It encapsulates a brilliant blend of storytelling, world-building, graphics, and sound that immerses players in a captivating and memorable adventure. If you're a fan of FromSoftware's previous titles or just love a good fantasy epic, Elden Ring is a must-play.",True

The story, characters and interactions, althought not as high quality as the previous game, are by far the best parts of this. Especially the amount of them. You can probably replay this game 5 time and still find new interactions here and there. Oh and Gwent.
The combat is alright, but you need to play on harder difficulties to make the most of it.
The open world is well done, but it brings the usual issues that open world bring with them. Empty areas, long travel times ect. but it makes up for it with all the interactions you can encounter.
Both DLC's are amazing too, especially Toussaint, which quickly became my favorite area.

,147961821,"Long Story short, it is still a worth it game in 2023 (only on sale, though): 8.5/10 from me!

Now, long story long....

Story: Great story, characters and their back stories too, a little long story though but it makes up for the immersion that it offers you and you don't feel like you have nothing to do or just sit there and let the cut scenes play and pretend that it is a movie. No, it is not like that. Every choice the game offers you, impacts your journey in one way or the other and the ending as well. So, it is totally up to you how you want to act in situations and shape your own destiny and relations with other characters.

Gameplay: Good game-play and mechanics once you get used to it. I got into this game after playing and completing Assassin's Creed Origins, Odyssey & Valhalla so it took me a little while to adapt into the systems of this game. 

Exploration: I have only done the exploration while completing the story but it is great & I mean it. While the horse and boat are the two main ways to boost your time in exploring, they don't feel that much satisfying to use instead, they felt like hampering my speed and being an obstruction in my play style.

Battle/Combat: Don't except it to be phenomenal like Dark Souls but it is engaging and feels good.

Dialogues/Conversations: This stuff during a mission/quest feels so much natural! The characters behave so natural during conversations like their mood when talking, their body language, their facial expressions ,etc.

1. The combat is some of the dullest most boring combat I've come across in a RPG, how this is when its an action RPG I dunno, but it just feels slow and off like they were trying to make KOTR but got it all wrong..,...

2. The Gfx, this game is hyped for amazing gfx, but even on ultra, all I see is a old DX9 game running really poorly on DX11\12 hardware... the gfx are not amazing and very wasteful on gpu  power consumption as there not optimized for what they are.

3. Story... Extremely Generic. I read alot of fantasy novels so... I'm harsher here then many and nothing about it got me hooked to want to keep playing.

Thoughts....

Played for 11hrs.... game just got insanely boring, and had to deal with crashes constantly when loading the inventory screen till I found a post saying to disable hairworks which fixes the crashes....  Why have the developers of a game from 2015 not fixed such an issue? I don't know, they rather add useless things like Ray-tracing to a game with medicore gfx. then fix game breaking issues, or making an interesting story.

,144104816,"This is a review of the base game, i will update as i finish the dlcs.
i have just finished the game on the hardest difficulty, and will comment on it.
it took about 40 hours completing the main story and every sub quest apart from gwent related ones. the main story is incredible and all the characters are interesting and great to meet. but were the game truly shines is the secondary quests, as they most of the time have an interesting twist. the immense freedom this game gives you in when and how you accomplish most things is incredible. most actions will have a repercussion in some way or another. they are many mechanics made for you to have an easy time running around without having to think too much.

the bad : horse riding is clunky, very little control and many bugs. playing ciri in the main quest is a fun twist but annoying to see all the hours of grinding to make it all easy disappear.  the scenery is fantastic only if it wasn't raining all the time in-game. 
overall, this is definitively on of the best games out there, heavily recommend.

completion of dlc 1 hearts and stone : the main story line was interesting, and it was all easy to guess if you followed the lore are hints given left and right. i enjoyed that is was short and efficient. now on the bad side, some boss fight were frustrating, as they didn't compliment the combat style of the game. they were very few secondary quests i found while doing the main, and the price to start enchanting gear is crazy high, which doesn't make you want to try different builds.
DLC 2 : beautiful scenery, really hoping the next game keeps those vibrant colours. the main story was interesting and efficient, with multiple endings again. 
overall, a fantastic game, that gives me great expectations for the next one. i thought it was a nice end for the geralt story line as well",True

Dark Souls is the best RPG I have ever played. Spent thousands of hours on PS3 and other platforms, making me a forever FROMSOFTWARE fan. Everything about the game is borderline perfect besides the dreaded ''walk of shame'' with certain bonfires. Some areas like Tomb of the Giants and Anor Londo for example, will have you restart the entire area and fight or run past hard hitting enemies if you die to the boss. Either wasting precious healing items or possibly dying and losing your blood stain in the boss arena. Making some areas incredibly frustrating and tedious.

,146936758,"Title: An Epic Return to Darkness - ""DARK SOULS™: REMASTERED""

Rating: ★★★★★

""DARK SOULS™: REMASTERED"" by FromSoftware, Inc. is a masterpiece that needs no introduction for fans of the souls-like genre. As a seasoned undead adventurer, I've delved into the abyss of Lordran once again, and this remastered edition is a testament to the timeless brilliance of the original game.

Graphically, ""DARK SOULS™: REMASTERED"" breathes new life into the dark and atmospheric world of Lordran. While it doesn't overhaul the visuals entirely, the improvements are significant. The enhanced lighting and textures make every corner of this grim, interconnected world more captivating than ever before. The character models and environments are more detailed, creating a more immersive experience while still preserving the iconic aesthetics that define the series.

Gameplay-wise, ""DARK SOULS™: REMASTERED"" remains the benchmark for challenging and rewarding gameplay. The combat mechanics are as tight and precise as ever, demanding mastery of weapon types, timing, and strategy. The sense of accomplishment when conquering formidable foes or navigating treacherous terrain is unmatched. The game's notorious difficulty is not arbitrary; it's a beautifully crafted challenge that forces you to learn and adapt, making each victory all the more satisfying.

The level design is, once again, a standout feature. Lordran is a sprawling, interconnected world filled with secrets, shortcuts, and hidden lore. The non-linear progression allows for diverse playstyles and encourages exploration, making it impossible to resist the urge to revisit areas and uncover every hidden gem. The world feels alive, brimming with mysteries waiting to be uncovered.

The online multiplayer aspect remains a unique and integral part of the experience. Jolly cooperation, tense invasions, and cryptic messages from other players continue to add an extra layer of depth and unpredictability to the game world. Whether you're seeking aid or plotting the downfall of other adventurers, the multiplayer interactions are a testament to the game's enduring appeal.

""DARK SOULS™: REMASTERED"" is more than just a nostalgia trip; it's an essential upgrade for both newcomers and veterans alike. The technical enhancements, while not groundbreaking, improve the overall experience without compromising the game's original vision. It's a testament to FromSoftware's dedication to their fanbase and the legacy of this iconic series.

In conclusion, ""DARK SOULS™: REMASTERED"" is an unforgettable journey into a dark and challenging world that continues to stand the test of time. It's a must-play for anyone seeking an immersive, punishing, and ultimately rewarding gaming experience. Whether you're reliving the past or embarking on your first adventure, this remastered edition is a definitive way to experience the masterpiece that started it all. Praise the sun!",True

===================================================================

My first ever Soulsborne Game! At first, I was thinking that ""Dark Souls is hard"" is such an overused phrase, but I realize now that this Game can really be punishing whenever it gets a chance to. The ""hard"" part is that you actually have to think before you do anything but at the same time you almost don't have a chance to think at all, especially when you're faced with Boss Battles. There are things that will make your life more difficult in this game, like accidentally hitting NPCs will make them hostile towards you (NPCs are really helpful in this game) and facing enemies in narrow spaces feels like hell because your character's attacks bounce off of walls.. BUT, I enjoyed the game so much! The feeling of finally defeating that one annoying enemy after several attempts can be really rewarding and actually makes me want to explore more of what's ahead after.

As for the LORE, it is just magnificent. I can't get enough of the Lore this game has to offer and the Game doesn't just give it to you only by text but also by the world-building (Game Level and NPC Position) within the Game. The reason why something happened is always intriguing from the beginning 'till the end. I can't wait until I finally get the chance to play Dark Souls II. Oh yeah, a little bit about the Game Mechanic and Character Build, the Battle is ""easy to learn, hard to master"" kinda mechanic but there's no one OP weapon or Armor Set, so try to use whatever you fancy. My suggestion is always try to balance between melee and range attacks. In my case, I used Pyromancy/Uchigatana/Arrow Combination and this is really helpful to defeat many kinds of enemies.

===================================================================

I'm gonna give this game a ""Great Grey Wolf Sif"" out of ""Artorias the Abysswalker""",True
,146917831,"[OBLIGATORY SPOILER WARNING]

Things that are good:

- The first half is genuinely good designed, including environmental storytelling, intuative 
  leads towards the intended path and interlooping map design.
- Any of the many builds available can work if you know what you are doing.
- Primary gameplay loop is actual fun while still being challenging, a very new and innovative 
  concept for AAA games these days...
- Story is one of the best in gaming history. Prepare thyself for many hours of hunting down 
  every bit of lore.

Things that p*ss me off and will trigger you too:

- Why the f*ck is the dodge direction bound to the camera lock? When unlocked you can
  dodge in any direction you input, but when you lock on you can only dodge in 4 directions 
  wich will f*ck you when facing later bosses.
- Why THE F*CK is the lock-on distance different in every area? Not much of a problem if you 
  have a melee build 'cause you can play unlocked but if you play a mage of some kind you 
  basically HAVE to play locked-on and in specific areas like the Duke's Archives you cant lock 
  on shit even if its only a metre or two in front of you.
- Yeah, a game from 2011 has kinda shitty hitboxes sometimes. Not as bad it sounds 
  though...
- The second half just falls flat and dips its sh*tty little nose in some sh*tty little Izalith lava 
  before dropping in a sh*tty little hole in the sh*tty little dephs.
- After you gain the ability to warp from bonfire to bonfire you will be asking yourself why tf 
  you can warp ONLY to specific bonfires. Backtracking will become a chore since the level 
  design aint as good as it was in the first half.
- Speaking of wich, in the later half most boss arenas are outright hostile to you be it through 
  too little space, the arena being filled with enemies IN ADDITION to the boss, unavoidable 
  drop damage or the game suddenly becoming a platformer with no dedicated 
  jump button. F*ck Nito and the Centipede Demon and f*ck the Bed Of Chaos in particular.
- The game mechanics outside of basic controls are not explained to you. Like, not at all. I 
  strongly suggest 
  watching/reading a guide after you arrive in Firelink Shrine 'cause the game is about as 
  eager to explain it 
  all to you as Gwyn is to let the Age of Fire die.

This is still my favorite Dark Souls game even if it is the most Yankee of them, but maybe that is why I love it so much. It has that feeling of being an adventure and all the times you almost fall to your deaths. It's amazing and it has some really good secret boss fights that makes it feels like the game is not all what you see.

Did you ever played the original Silent Hill 2 for the PS2 and then years later bought the HD Collection and were like: ""Wow!, this looks worse"" well, I've got bad news for you, this ""Remaster"" makes SH2:HD look decent.

The special effects are better overall and the game runs at 60 fps so, there was a try, BUT, it feels like they improved that and at the middle of the way said: ""that's it, we're done, the Remaster is complete"". They implemented a new and better lighting system to the game so, the game must look better, right? Well, it  kills the original atmosphere in a lot of areas and also it makes almost everything look worse. For whatever reason a lot of armor sets and armor that the enemies are wearing look worse as if they directly tried to downgrade them. Some NPC's faces look better and less polygonal but most of them look worse. Then we've got the textures of the environment, a lot of them got improved but others look as if they tried to make them worse.

Only about 20% of the new stuff looks better than the original and for that I don't recommend it. If you have the original version just mod it so it runs at those magnificent 60 fps; if you don't, well, time for some heavy modding so this doesn't look like the downgraded version of the original.

Gwynevere.
It's Dark Souls.
Musics are aight.
No performance issues.
Pretty good for the first game in the series
Open levels design which lead to surprise shortcuts.
Graphic is alright for a remaster of a really old game.
Really hard, probably the hardest one in the series, but* -> Cons.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
Inventory management is a nightmare, the UI is cursed, could have got a rework to be more like DS3.
No fast travel until half of the game, even then you can't fast travel to all bonfire, collecting items and running to vendors are very tedious.
Some of the worst boss designs in the entire series, some of them aren't even worth being called a boss.
Dated, slow combat, you can only dodge one time, chaining dodges isn't possible, you have to take a break after every dodge.
*Quite boring, bosses have like 5 attacks at best, combat play out like a turn-based game, boss attack -> you dodged -> you attack, rinse & repeat.
Your experiences may vary depends on which area you choose to go first, pick the wrong area and you'll want to uninstall the game, playing this game blind is the worst thing you could do which is the opposite of other games in the series and Elden Ring.

To sum up, it's a souls game with minimal enjoyment, much more boring and annoying to play unlike other games in the series but it's not a bad game that deserve a negative review, give us a Neutral option STEAM. Play this if you want to appreciate how far souls games have come otherwise ignore this game, you won't be missing out much.",True

Gameplay ages like fine wine, and while the graphics aren't obviously cutting edge now, the art direction carries it and still manages to be beautiful. The open level design is obviously what this game does better than the other souls games. But it is an inconsistent experience with a couple of questionable gameplay elements that is more inconvenient than challenging.

If you dont have it then u never a gamer be",True
,146163554,"I would prefer rating this as ""Neutral"", but since I spent a lot of time with it, positive is fine.

So, let's start with the bad stuff:

[list]
   [*] Controls are clanky at times. I know the game is supposed to be slow and thoughtful while also reactive, but sometimes it just feels weird.

   [*] Bonfires. They're awesome in general, but 2 things I hate about them: 1. They're never (except one single time) right in front of a boss. Every god damn time, you after you die to a boss, which will happen, before fighting him again, you need to walk for 5 minutes. The way isn't a challenge anymore after you've done it 3 times. 2. Their warping ability. It's a great mechanic and I like that you get midgame and not from the beginning. But god damn you can only warp to a couple of them, so more walking... 

   [*] Stamina Bar. It's always annoying. Sure it is intended to make you think etc and be careful with your resources but there are better ways to solve this.

   [*] The skill system. Overall it's okay, but some details about it are strange. Resistance for example seems completely useless. Also, the higher your numbers get, the less they will increase. I already started NG+ and I had to do a lot of farming to actually feel a difference in my damage numbers. You also can't upgrade weapons further in NG+, so I guess you just have to hit more.

   [*] After a certain point, the game becomes less enjoyable IMO. To be precise: [spoiler] The new areas after you get the Lordvessel are not as exciting as the game is up to that point, Especially Lost Izalith/Demon Ruins and the Duke's Archive [/spoiler]

   [*] It is quite a task to compare items/equipment, expecially when you don't know what some of the stats are actually meaning. I mean these unusual stats are very nice and should be added to more RPGs, but overall it's not too easy to decide what to use or to even realize what's your best option. And not even to start with how you want to upgrade your stuff, especially weapons.
[/list]

But, that aside, there's also a lot of good stuff that kept me going:

[list]
   [*] Obviously the difficulty. It teaches you to be considerable about your actions. Not only in battle but also with the quests the game offers. It makes you learn what your enemies are doing so you can react accordingly. Every hit you take or deliver can be crucial.

   [*] Combat, even besides the difficulty, is awesome. You have a lot more weapon types than in typical RPGs, you can chose between wielding all of them one or two handed. You can choose to block, parry or dodge attacks. Although bows aren't really meant as a main weapon you can still use them occasionally. Magic is also a little weird, as your spells have limited uses and you don't have something like Mana. If you're out of spells, you have to have an alternative.

   [*] The world is great. You can visit basically like 90% of what you're seeing (except very far background), it's interconnected, not repetitive, atmospheric and interesting. I would like to see some more NPCs just to fill some places, but it's fine as it is. But the NPCs that are there already are very nice already.

   [*] Basically right from the beginning, you get awesome looking gear. At least for some classes/build, most weapons and armor look fantastic! You can actually start the game with fully fleshed out knight armor.

   [*] And one of the aspects which FromSoftware is know for: Bosses. They are incredible. Menacing, awesome looking and with great variety!

Why?

Elden Ring (ER), that's why.

Granted, I believe they made Elden Ring more of my style because this s**t was hard.  Not that ER was easy, but I did not have to run down a chasm to repeat a boss fight in Elden Ring.  I'm happily satisfied that the devs made that change for ER, but DS is the OG so... yes you have to run down a chasm, hoping not to take too many hits, to repeat a boss fight.  

Anyways, I hold the record for most refunds for Dark Souls Remastered.  TBH, it's going to take 10-20 hours to really feel the ""feels"" if you know what i'm saying. . . And once you do, you'll agree that Dark Souls is easily one of the best games ever. 

Trust the guy who has refunded this like, 17 times.  I also killed all the NPCs in the starting shrine out of frustration which I would NOT recommend doing because, come to find out, they sell you useful items later in the game (Doh!) and you can't respec. . . So, me losing my 49,000 souls (repeatedly) from non-boss fights, sent me into a black-out rage.  Once I came to, they were gone; do not do what I did.

If i want to keep it brief, I would just say The Dark souls Remastered is a masterpieces, thru and thru. From the beginning on the undead asylum to end of the kiln of the first flame, this game was captivating and mesmerising. I could only wonder how much a vast and detailed world of Lordran was created for us, the chosen undead, to be a part of; to be the one saving or dooming it as we see fit. The game, the lore, the combat, the equipment and stat system, the inter-connectivity of different areas was really a joy to explore and experience. 
Its evident why this was amongst the titles that gave birth to the sub-genre called 'souls-like'.

I don't know why i have not played the dark souls trilogy before, but now when i am, i just couldn't get enough of it. Playing and finishing this game made me realise why these series by Fromsoftwares are so popular and I myself am in love with it.

The bonfire fire looks more realistic but lost its original mystical look (just look at the bonefires at the bottom left of the loading screens).  If it wasn't for the fact that they stopped selling the original release and ended its online service, I would be recommending it instead.",False
,146624646,"So many flaws but is considered the best dark souls game? 

-Terrible claustrophobic and narrow areas where the developers find it necessary to have either a hard as hell enemy waiting, or hordes of easier enemies who spam all at once, getting multiple hits in on you. This doesn't help when you are halfway through an attack animation but is canceled if they hit you (they will hit you).

-Random trap floors that can screw you over and cause you to lose souls and humanity, landing you in the nest of enemies but not only that, but for some reason you get fall damage for falling through these unsuspecting collapsing floors. One example is when returning to Undead Asylum and you fall through the floor to fight a boss, but the game unfairly causes you to lose health upon hitting the floor, leaving you vulnerable to be hit a single time from the boss that will send you back to the bonfire.

-Backstabbing (by far the most broken mechanic) is complete sh**, so many occasions where a random will invade and somehow get back-stab after back-stab. This wouldn't be as much of a problem if it was fair, but I encountered countless enemies and invaders who somehow managed to activate these back-stabs even when looking directly at me or when I have rolled out of the way of their attack but the game registers it as a back-stab.

This game has its moments where I find enjoyment from playing and exploring, but this is heavily watered down by the ridiculous design choices and bugs that commonly occur throughout your playthrough. This being said, it is not the worse game but also not the best of the series, it has spirit and love put into it, and I do recommend others to try it and judge it for themselves, this is only my opinion based on my experience with the product

,132061498,"So, I have been playing all souls games a lot and I have to say DS2 is my favorite game to come back to:
* The combat is well refined and fun. 
* The difficulty curve is well-balanced and good both for beginners and advanced players. 
* There are plenty of weapons and spells that offer a lot of replayability.
* There are (almost) always multiple paths you can take through the game, so you are unlikely to get stuck. 

On the negative side, the graphics have not aged so well and some areas are just plain ugly. There are also some boss fights which are recycled later on in the game, which is a bit underwhelming. But all that being said, I can recommend this game a lot. It offers a lot of content and feels pleasant and challenging to play.",True

DS2 is equal with every Souls game. the only flaw it has that other Souls players often get criticized might just be the sense of the rushed uninterconnected world map. overall it has amazing art style and an improvement from previous Souls.

Another thing, I'll tell you this vanilla version running better than SOTFS for low end pc/laptop user. I have installed this version on my laptop with core i3 6006 iu, 4GB RAM + Intel HD 520 (128 VRAM). With Maximum setting + 720p resolution and the game can run on 40-60 FPS.

,12640942,"In comparison with original Dark Souls, the sequel is weak. Locations not properly connected between each other. Bonfires quantity way much more than in Dark Souls 1, so distances between them now less. Healing with Estus is slow, and healing stones are a safe option in this game, and you can have 99 of each (like grass from Demon's Souls). But not only Estus Flask and healing stones are an option for replenish HP bar, this game has a lot of items that have healing status. Miracles also included. Game also have death penalties, with each death HP bar will decrease to maximum 50%. Almost like from Demon's Souls. But, in the beginning of the game, you can get a ring that increasing HP bar while being Hollow (like Cling Ring in Demon's Souls). And speaking about Death in Dark Souls II, it's still not a big deal because in the sequel there are a lot of Rings of Life Protection that prevent losing souls and human form after death. And they can be repaired with Blacksmith, when in first Dark Souls they got broken and there was no option to repair them.
Hit boxes in this game are trash, and for i-frames (and speed of drinking Estus) there's now a new attribute to level - Adaptation. So, If you want more traditional amount of i-frames, you need to level it.
Also, you can now being invaded by players while being Hollow. PvP is okay. I'm not a fan of it, so I cannot describe it with details. And about online multiplayer. For matchmaking/summoning, there's a new gameplay mechanic named ""Soul Memory"". This mechanic tracks the total number of souls you obtain while playing on one character, and it makes life harder If you want to play with friends, and you want to play solo and farm some stuff. If the difference between yours and your friend's Soul Memories will be big - you can't play with each other.
PvE is mediocre. Almost every enemy is a humanoid with basic design. There are a lot of bosses, but the quality of them can be Good to Copy+Paste gang mobs.
But still, Dark Souls II have some good stuff too. Like, Weapon Stances - you can wield weapons with both hands in same time. Items now have multiple levels that normally can be obtainable in NG+ or in DLC. NG+ now a little bit differs in comparison with NG. Not that much, but still it's better than nothing. Armour sets in Dark Souls II, more ""fashionable"" that it's also good.
Did I have fun while playing this game? Yes. Kinda... Not the same amount as with Dark Souls 1. Still, I would say that If you want to play FromSoftware games, I would encourage you to try Dark Souls sequel. You will love it or going to hate it.

The attack mechanics are terrible, even a slight angle off and you miss.  I don't want to have to be that precise in a real time combat.
Where you are and what you are doing is not explained.  Maybe you would know this if you played the First Game, I don't know.  So the story also sucks because I have no idea what it is.

,131206805,"I'll say upfront that I consider myself a die hard fan of the series, I've played through Dark Souls and Dark Souls III several times over and have a 100% completion in Elden Ring for what its worth. Beyond that I want to add that I have attempted to approach this game in earnest 4 separate times now and while I have nearly completed it as of writing this, I will say that I feel that I have more than enough time invested to have a thoroughly informed opinion.

I'll simply put it this way, Dark Souls II AND the Scholar of the First sin do not exist in a condition that put it at the same level of quality as the others in the series. Oversights run amok such as strange hit boxes, haphazard enemy placement and strange attack animations that somehow manage to look both lethargic and fast.  Environmental hazards are only ever presented in a way that readies the player for a challenge when they find a message left by someone else who already dealt with it. Ambushes and ganks are far too common and challenges go from feeling like carefully balanced and crafted encounters of the other games to someone's poorly laid out home brew D&D campaign made into a video game. I'm willing to give developers the benefit of the doubt up to a point. Making games is incredibly difficult and making a good game on top of that is nothing short of a miracle at times and that's not factoring pressures from publishers with budgets and deadlines.

All that said, there's an amateur feel to much of the game's experience. I won't comment on how life gems and other healing items destroy the balance of the game or trample over Demon's Souls/ Dark Souls sacred ground, but they do feel like a hasty choice made by designers who were pushed into creating artificially inflated difficult areas and realizing that the Estus Flask alone would not be enough to get players through significant portions of the game, especially with how difficult it seems to be to find Estus Shards. Beyond that, the layout of levels feel like they came from people who took extensive notes on the previous games overall world design and when it came time to put things together, realized it was too late to actually do anything about it beyond stitch them together and hope it would pass. I know there are a multitude of examples you've already seen because if you're reading this review, you've almost certainly read/ heard it from someone else who can actually pay their bills to write this extensively about a game that's almost 9 years old at the time of writing. The Iron Keep has been almost turned into a buzzword for how nonsensical this game can feel at points, not only in the transition to the level, but for the fact that it doesn't even feel like a keep and closer to a video game level centered around a castle full of lava, though I find that to be true of most castle environments in the game. In an example I haven't seen mentioned, arenas for the Demon of Song, Rotten and Duke's Dear Freya all had small cave like exits dug into the walls that weren't even all that easy to see. In the case of all three of these spaces I naturally thought I must've hit the dead end of that path and left only to find out after Googling that I had actually missed the exit as it appeared to blend into the wall around it with the texture and weird lighting.

I won't comment on things like the story outright because everyone will take something different away from that and frankly no part of the Souls Series will ever do this in a way that makes everyone happy. I don't have a problem with the opening or even Aldia's musings on the nature of the world the character inhabits. What I found deeply convoluted was everything after King Vendrick's encounter. While I don't really care about how linear or open a game is so long as it's good, I do care about feeling a drive as to where I should be going so that I can propel the story further and experience more of the game. The only other ending can be achieved by killing Vendrick. I never tried attacking him without having done the Memories of the Ancients first, but in what might be the greatest twist of my evening is as I write this I didn't know this was all completely optional UNTIL I looked it up to write this review. Seriously. Why else would I be given this ring to open doors to more levels was my thinking. I assumed that I was working towards a greater goal that would get me to the end of the game but in the end it turns out it was for something I wasn't actually interested in doing in the first place.

This leads me to my last real gripe with this game and that's time. I sunk over 50 hours into attempting to complete this game on this one save, not counting other attempts on the Scholar version. That's quite a few, but I put in just shy of 60 in DS1 and that includes the DLC and starting a New Game+ run AND waiting around to help a friend with bosses. I'm going to hit roughly that same amount of time by the time I have finished the first save without doing any DLC. This thing gets monotonous at points. Running back to some bosses is a marathon if you assume you've already killed every enemy to the point they stay permanently dead and even that is a major time sink depending on the area. I don't find bosses engaging, just a larger special looking enemy whose health I chip away it. Enemies aggro inconsistently and some times far too aggressively making the trek back to bosses as arduous and risky as your first attempt at reaching the fog gate and if you're like me and get drained of your life gems you go to an easier area and farm souls just to buy more, taking more time out of actually experiencing something new as you try to get around another place you're stuck in.

I haven't even mentioned the downright deplorable business practices being taken by selling what is essentially a somewhat modified version of the base game with a graphical fidelity that should've been in the base game at launch when it comes to Scholar of the First Sin Edition. It isn't helped at all when it is touted as the definitive version of the game which means everything else that might be a real flaw that needs a closer look is now a double down on the choices made by all involved from what I can see as an outsider and what I've listed in this paragraph are the reasons why it's hard to take zealot defenders of this game in particular in good faith. Don't get me wrong, every Fromsoft game has flaws but this one has a few too many straws that breaks the camels back for my liking. I deeply care about this series, but this one just isn't up to scratch like the other releases.

I cannot recommend this game on its own merits, even as a Dark Souls game. I especially cannot recommend purchasing Scholar of the First Sin in good faith from one consumer to another. I'm glad to be living in a time where DS1 and Demon Souls aren't the only other games I can point to for good Souls-likes by From and I highly recommend giving those ones, DS3, or Elden Ring instead.

,130908224,"Dark Souls II has been widely criticized for many reasons and while I partially agree with most of them. Dark Souls II is still a pretty good game. Now I originally played this on an Xbox One and it was the SOTFS version first because it was only available on newer consoles and that is not a good thing. SOTFS version, while it is better in graphics and performance, what it severly lacks is the fun and progression that this first one has. The main reason being that in SOTFS the developers intended it for people who already played the og DS II so they put harder and more ridiculous encounters in the game expecting that new players will be able to beat them. After failing to complete DS II SOTFS on xbox and I switched to OG on the PC. I had much more fun playing and while I'm certainly not at the end I must say that THIS is the best version of Dark Souls II and now you should even get the DLC's free with the base game (or at least I have). This may not be the best game from the souls series and I think for starters games Like Dark Souls 1 or Bloodborne are better. Dark Souls II is still a pretty fun and challenging game for both seasoned Dark Souls Veterans or People that have never played any Dark Souls Game.

,130556444,"Dark Souls 2 is a weird sequel to the first game, adding in new mechanics and a new cast of characters to boot, all packed into a whole new land to explore. Yet is despised for its clunky combat, unforgiving areas, and just some other personal utter bullsh#t. Even then, Dark Souls 2 is a Souls Game and should be treated as such. Not saying you have to like it, fu#k change but hear me out will ya. Dark Souls 2 in all its flaws, shines the brightest when comparing it to the Scholar of the First Sin Edition of the Game. Scholar of the First Sin, does adds a few shortcuts, moves some items around, and looks sexy as fu#k, but its jammed pack with bullsh#t enemies placements that makes you wanna scream nig#er at the damn screen. Luckily, you're reading a Dark Souls 2 Review and can easily buy the OG Dark Souls 2 and get a FAR better experience than the so called new and improved, Scholar of the First Sin - A 40 Dollar Heap of Garbage. Sorry for sounding like a hater recording some dumb Youtube video. I just want to make sure you're spending your money wisely while also keeping your sanity intact. So buy Dark Souls 2 and if you read on Reddit that the Scholar of the First Sin is better, they're lying and are just crying a river that Me and any other Chad who buys this version of the game, are having the best times with Dark Souls 2. With that all Said and Done, Thanks for Reading! Buy the OG Dark Souls 2 and Have Fun!",True

The areas are short and not crafted very well. The most difficult thing is getting swarmed by enemies while trying to traverse a level and the boss runbacks are the WORST as you cant run past the enemies on your way as you can get damaged out of the fog-entering animation.

edit- dark souls 2: scholar of the first sin is my favorite dark souls game. demon's souls is my favorite souls game but dark souls 2: scholar of the first sin is absolutely fantastic from the ground up. it is one of the best action rpgs ever put to console... and then ported to pc (still waiting for bloodborne, best if not my favorite souls game, on steam, rip). every single complaint anyone ever had about this game is a) a skill issue or b) they changed something from dark souls 1 for the better. because dark souls 1 wasn't perfect. dark souls 1 was heavily HEAVILY flawed from beginning to end, and scholar fixed nearly every single problem.

but this is not scholar. this was a mistake. this was rushed so hard. tanimura did what he could by cutting every single corner in order to make a playable- if irreparably broken- game. but what an achievement. it's fallout: new vegas levels of impressive. but it's also fallout: new vegas levels of jank. playing scholar before this made this so unfun [like playing og metro 2033 AFTER the redux]. the levels are so empty of anything to do or fight, the progression through the world is a lot more narrow and uninspired, and some of the key placements are the absolute worst. especially the DLC keys which are just popped into your inventory. enemy placements are also questionable at best. and worst of all you have to buy the DLC separately.

DS 1 was a jewel. The lore, the characters (Sif T . T , Artorias has beaten up my a**, love that dude) , the combat, the bosses. I thought DS 2 would be even better. Damn, I was wrong. 
The whole Overlay reminds me more on Gothic, than on Dark Souls. Some Friends warned me about this title, now I know why. The whole Movement feels kinda clumsy compared to part 1. I felt awkward playing this game.

Not everything is bad. Majula is the best hub ever, the music is so sad and great :_ ( the game is slower but that's a feature, there are themes that are different to other souls games, it has its own personality.
TBH DS3 is only ahead of this one because of how polished DS3 is in comparison. DS3 sucks in many ways compared to this one.

So, less-good souls of all but still very good. Not sure if recommended if you come from anything else than DS1 or are a hardened fan of the souls series.

The baffling thing is why does it try to connect every time! it takes a full minute to fail and then a have to click cancel to continue the game (god forbid you click continue cause it will try again for the full minute). I'm pretty sure the devs could have released a patch when they shut down the servers.
2. Why can't I change the FOV I am not playing on a TV and I am very close to the screen why do I need a mod to have basic functionality
3.  using the keyboard shouldn't be this hard, changing the camera sensitivity is impossible as it always reverts to the original, parrying REQUIRES TWO CLICKS why would you bind one of the most difficult actions to a combo of clicks??
4. Last of all the games crashes at least once every hour, is it fixable? probably but when the playing experience wasn't fun before it crashed I don't really have the motivation to do so.

I know it supposed to be a difficult game but the difficulty should not start before you have started playing, I would get a refund but sadly it took me too long to start playing (or try to) I have a controller",False

,123972634,"Honestly a very fun game. I am not going to say the flack it gets it not in many cases justified, but I honestly had a lot of fun with it. However, there is a big down to the game. I only had fun with the game when I was playing for the first time and when I started a new game as a new character. In other words NG+ also known as Scholars of the First Sin is not fun at all. It just adds more and harder enemies in different locations which only makes the game take needlessly longer and be more of a nuisance than anything else. 

Now, there are some heavy issues. Combat is extremely slow compared to Souls 1 and 3, just drinking from the Estus Flask feels like it takes ages and it does not heal you right away but slowly creeps up which is a major downgrade. The bosses are at least a little bit slower as well but it still feels like players reaction time was sacrificed more than that of the boss ones. So it feels they have more of an advantage where they should not have. 

But there is something this game has that does not really appeal that much to me when it comes to Souls 1 and 3. It is wanderlust and comfortable grinding. Now, the wanderlust thing I kind of feel with Souls 1 as well while the wanderlust is not as much existing in the 3rd game. But I really enjoy the story it tries to tell and honestly I can see it making sense in the lore as something that would take place after Souls 3 when it comes to the cyclical Age of Fire and Age of Darkness just taking new forms. 

As for the grinding, honestly, with the bit of a slower pace, I feel the game is a bit more chill and relaxing and just nice to grind. I can watch videos while grinding away for items or souls. Now enemies eventually dying out after killing them enough times is a problem, it can at least be solved with a Bonfire Ascetic. I am not fond of difficult grinding like Destiny 2 or other games where you have to constantly be at it to keep up, I appreciate the more slow ones where you build yourself up in single-player as you go along. So yeah, the game is a pretty chill one for me. 

I do love the other Souls games as well and when it comes to combat and boss fights, Souls 1 and 3 are definitely far superior to Souls 2 no questions asked. But this game, I just found it to be relaxingly fun. That was the feeling I felt after playing the game for the first time, then lost that feeling once I started NG+ but then regained again when I started the game as a new character~",True

The music is better and the general world feels more fleshed out than Elden Ring and that's about it. Overall the bosses have been worse, the enemies have been worse, and the level design has been worse. This makes sense because it's 6 years older than Elden Ring. But I can't help but feel oversold on this game. A lot- and I really mean a lot -of people told me the bosses were better and rival Elden Ring. I just have to disagree. So far the only one I've felt is even close were the Abyss watchers. But after getting a bit into the game (and having my save deleted, thanks From) I just really feel let down. This is my own experience, but I just want to warn people that if you loved Elden Ring, you might rub up against this game.

I was able to lower the graphics enough to run the game quite well on a computer that doesn't take kindly to all games. The only downsides I've been having is a single technical camera glitch and a tutorial issue regarding keyboard controls. The game doesn't detect if you are playing with the keyboard, and will only display button prompts during the tutorials and menus using controller schemes. This makes it very difficult starting out with the game to learn the controls. Beyond that, it is definitely a game worth playing!",True

Concretely, it's a Guitar Hero but with RPG fantasy. You have to click at the exact timing and each enemy is a new song that you have to know by heart. I hate it.
Fighting is a chore. As soon as you get hit, you are interrupted, which is very painful: Your character no longer responds, it's not smooth. When you block an attack it drains all your stamina. So all you have to do is roll on the ground, again and again. You will have to dodge every 0.5 seconds. Dodge/attack, dodge/attack, and again, and again...

The big good point of the game is its map which is relatively large, full of secret passages, with very varied, epic and ""beautiful"" environments with a lot of verticality.
But the semi-autistic combat system coupled with the lack of difficulty option makes this game a very bad game. You don't want to give me difficulty options ? Very good, I am not giving you a positive review. ; )

Rating: ★★★★★

""DARK SOULS™ III"" by FromSoftware, Inc. is a magnificent and fitting conclusion to the epic Souls series, showcasing the studio's mastery of challenging gameplay, hauntingly beautiful graphics, and deep, interconnected world-building.

Graphically, ""DARK SOULS™ III"" is a visual tour de force. It takes the series to new heights with breathtaking environments, meticulously detailed character models, and hauntingly atmospheric lighting. The game's gothic and decaying world is both stunning and nightmarish, creating an unparalleled sense of immersion. From crumbling castles to corrupted swamps, every location feels like a work of art, and the overall visual design elevates the dark fantasy genre to new standards.

Gameplay-wise, ""DARK SOULS™ III"" continues to refine the series' signature mechanics. Combat is precise, demanding mastery of weapon types, dodging, and parrying. The addition of weapon arts adds depth to combat, providing new ways to approach battles. The difficulty is relentless but fair, making every victory a hard-fought achievement and every defeat a lesson in perseverance.

The level design is a masterpiece, harkening back to the interconnected world of the original ""DARK SOULS."" The world of Lothric is a sprawling labyrinth filled with shortcuts, hidden secrets, and lore waiting to be uncovered. The sense of discovery is palpable, encouraging exploration and experimentation. The non-linear progression allows players to forge their own path and make meaningful choices, enhancing replayability.

Storytelling in ""DARK SOULS™ III"" strikes a delicate balance between cryptic and accessible. It weaves a tale of fallen kingdoms, cosmic horrors, and the cycle of fire and darkness. While it offers more narrative clarity than its predecessors, it still leaves room for interpretation and speculation, catering to both series veterans and newcomers.

The online multiplayer aspect is as compelling as ever, offering cooperative play and player-versus-player interactions. The game's covenants add depth to the multiplayer experience, providing various ways to engage with other players and earn unique rewards.

In conclusion, ""DARK SOULS™ III"" is a triumphant culmination of FromSoftware's vision for the series. It pushes the boundaries of what action RPGs can achieve with its stunning graphics, refined gameplay, and rich world-building. Whether you're a longtime fan of the Souls series or a newcomer looking for a challenging and unforgettable gaming experience, ""DARK SOULS™ III"" is a dark and beautiful journey into the abyss that shouldn't be missed.

,146868080,"Unlike Dark Souls 2, Dark Souls 3 is a massive improvement to practically every feature from its predecessors.  Combat is more fluid, the graphics are beautiful, weapon options are vast and varied and boss fights for the most part are much, much better.

Where DS3 really strives where the previous games weren't as strong was in its requirement that the player be adaptive in their builds.  For DS1 and 2, I never needed to change my weapons.  I stuck with a big heavy sword, and never diverted from it.  DS3, on the other hand, will throw curveballs at you that you need to adjust for.  I bullheadedly smashed my head against Nameless King with the Profaned Greatsword (an incredibly slow, heavy weapon,) and nearly lost my mind to it.  When I still struggled with Sister Friede in the same way, I decided it was time to change things up, and what a difference it made.

The game will absolutely reward you for being mindful of your builds, and approaching bosses strategically.  I was so used to the more blunt approach of DS1 and 2 that it's rather sad it took me so long to learn this lesson, as it might have made a lot of bosses much much cleaner.  Regardless, bosses are much more of a spectacle than the previous games, which makes the fights extremely memorable.  All in all, it's highly recommended as the final chapter to the Souls series.

If you do plan on getting the DLCs, a word of caution.  While I would say overall I still enjoyed the DLCs, there are a small sections of really painful points in them, with terribly long gauntlets that are very difficult to just run past.  It goes without saying that the bosses are much, MUCH harder than the base game, but if you take my previous note to heart about adapting your builds, it wont be something you can't overcome.

It's been quite a journey, to be honest.  Playing Elden Ring was what got me to try the Souls games, and now I've finally gone through them all.  There were ups, and there were downs (mostly downs for DS2) but in the end it was a fun experience, and I'm glad I played them.",True

Some specific grievances first off the layers of hell as I call them, Hell V0.75 Faraam Swamp the poison hell, Hell V1.2 Catacombs of Carthus never enough stamina hell, Hell V2.5 Irithyll Dungeon the why is my health bar gone hell. That aside I've loved playing this game I love helping with bosses I love so many bosses the fights are often fair and feel like you're actually fighting them rather than watching pure spectacles, the world feels a lot more complete with item descriptions you can learn so much. Finishing NPC quest lines tho would be immensely difficult without a guide and while it is somewhat upsetting I frankly don't mind it as it adds to the feeling of this being a living breathing world, I mean how often do strangers you talk to just tell you where they'll be later? After my almost 280 hours of being immersed in this world and its characters I'd highly recommend others play this game, and my advice is to take your time and stay as relaxed as possible so you can focus on everything in front above and behind, dying doesn't mean you failed you just hit a speed bump take your time to squish it.",True

Simple review details - I rank games on an out of 10 basis, granting up to 3 points in 3 categories, as well as a last, single point from my own self, depending on my experience with it.

GAMEPLAY

As a 2D sidescrolling metroid-vania with souls-like (roguelike) elements, Hollow Knight is an interesting mixture of things. It gives the Player a Player Character (PC) to control, gives the Player a weapon to use and a vast world to explore. As the Player encounters more and more Characters, finds more and more treasures and defeats more and more enemies, the PC grows not only more powerful, but also more capable at navigating the world.

Improvements such as the ability to jump while in the air, to dash through the air, to use spells, to jump off of walls, to illuminate dark areas and so on are all obtained following some kind of discovery or victory. In addition to that, everything else is also the fruit of some kind of labor – access to shortcuts, access to maps, access to safe spots – it is almost all bound to the Player’s performance and inquisitiveness.

However, this also brings with itself a problem. The amount of mobility and power that the Player gains as a result of their adventures winds up being strongly limited by the Charm system that is in effect – which is the equipment system in the game. The Player has access to only a few notches (slots) for Charms, and certain Charms require a certain number of notches to be equipped, allowing for a combination of 5 or 6 Charms, at most, to be equipped at a time, while there are more than 30 total Charms.

The issue is not that there is choice involved – the issue is that many of these Charms provide abilities that feel as though they ought to be simply had by the PC, rather than bound to the presence of a Charm. However, that is relatively minor by comparison to the other problem that truly plagues Hollow Knight:

 It is a soulslike, which means it is hard and inconvenient for the purposes of being such. Dying when fighting a boss does not position the PC next to the boss’ room, it positions the PC at a particular location that is a decently lengthy amount of travelling and fighting enemies away from the boss’ room. That’s just not conducive to a good experience.

Lastly, there is no value in replaying the game, as there are no alternative endings or builds that can be made use of – everything can be accomplished in one playthrough. The exception is the “die once, playthrough ends” gamemode, which negates the point of making Hollow Knight a soulslike, as the mechanic of going back to where the PC died and reclaiming what was lost is no longer in play.
2/3

PRESENTATION

Hollow Knight looks amazing, for it presents vast 2D spaces filled with incredibly fantastical sights and curious looking Characters who also sound and move in nealy magical ways. That, combined with the music and sound effects of this game create a magnificent meld of color and feeling, which only grows more potent as time goes on and the Player explores the spectacular world.

In addition to that, the themes this game explores in its story are mostly conveyed through the visuals of the game, performing great feats of environmental storytelling that bring great satisfaction and pleasure to the Player.
3/3

STORY

Hollow Knight presents a dead world which is being feasted upon by all manner of beasts, while a tiny number of Characters who have managed to keep their wits about themselves struggle to make do. It tells the tale of a mysterious knight who uncovers his past and his purpose and, in so doing, winds up saving that world and giving it life anew.

Aside from the story of the PC, Hollow Knight also features a plethora for colorful tales that almost always end on an incredibly somber note, yet it also presents a wonderfully vibrant and interesting world that awakens the Player’s imagination in a very splendid manner.

Alas, many questions remain unanswered and many Characters appear to be very unsatisfyingly concluded, as if unfinished and expecting a revalation in some subsequent installment of the story… Which is not nice.
2/3

Legendary Point

Does this game get the legendary point, so craved and wanted by all and none at the same time? I thought about this. Long and hard did I consider. I remember Hollow Knight with a mixture of both fondness and distaste. The gameplay left a sour taste in my mouth, and the unfinished feeling I got from the story added to it.

 I’m afraid I cannot give the Legendary point to Hollow Knight. It was a wonderful experience, but, alas, not one I would consider “touching”. 0/1

CONCLUSION

7/10. Hollow Knight is a good game. A game that I would not dissuade anybody from playing, but only warn them that it might be a little hard. It could have been better, but it is what it is.

 I tuck it under my belt, another achievement that I proudly display. Even though dotted by spots here and there, it is something wonderful.

i'm really enjoying the combat, atmosphere & music & also the enemy designs... but holy guaccamole the platforming with these mushrooms gets on my NERVES

edit; hi i'm here after playing a lot more of the game & i'm gonna recommend this game instead now. do not be like me & mald over hardness, you'll find this game's challenge actually makes it a lot of fun, give yourself a chance to improve at the mechanics & it becomes addictive; you also naturally just become better & more adept at finding your way & battling enemies, & upgrades make a huge difference to your boss fights! i completely recommend giving this guy a go, my advice if you're stuck, go to areas on the map you haven't cleared yet & look around, watch out for breakable walls etc.

,148034238,"I've delved deep into the world of countless video games, but few have captivated me as profoundly as Hollow Knight. This is an intricate masterpiece, beautifully crafted and meticulously detailed. From the very start, I was absorbed into its hauntingly serene atmosphere, with an art style that combines whimsical charm and eerie melancholy in a way that's nothing short of poetic.

The narrative of Hollow Knight is a compelling tapestry of mystery, built around a rich lore that slowly unfurls as you progress. Finishing the story was a fulfilling quest, one that left me deeply satisfied, having journeyed through poignant revelations and emotional highs and lows that are the marks of a well-crafted tale. It's a storyline that doesn't handhold or spoon-feed but rather respects the player's intelligence and curiosity.

Exploring the depths of Hallownest was an experience filled with thrilling combat, complex characters, and storytelling that's as subtle as it is impactful. The game's expansive world is a labyrinth of secrets and challenges, with each new area unveiling richer lore and more formidable foes. It kept me hooked, pushing me to achieve that nearly perfect 112% completion.

The combat system demands precision and strategy, and each boss—a work of art in itself—presents unique battles that test both skill and patience. Every new ability acquired opens the map in unexpected ways, making exploration addictive and victories all the more triumphant.

However, my truest test lay in the Pantheons, the ultimate showdowns of endurance. While the rest of the game was challenging, this was a gauntlet that required an almost transcendent state of zen-like focus. It was here that my journey paused, a decision born from respect for my enjoyment of the game rather than surrender. The fatigue was real, but it didn't tarnish my admiration for the game; it merely highlighted the intensity of the dedication required to truly conquer it.

In conclusion, Hollow Knight stands as a testament to the heights indie gaming has reached, offering a seamless blend of stunning visuals, a compelling narrative, and gameplay that's both challenging and rewarding. Though my journey halted just shy of absolute completion, the experience, particularly the poignant story completion, was unforgettable and remains a high point of my gaming life. To Team Cherry - You've created not just a game, but a world that lingers long in many hearts, mine included.",True

Additionally, the game's captivating ambiance is exquisitely paired with its evocative soundtrack. The meticulously hand-drawn world of Hallownest is nothing short of hauntingly beautiful, making it an artful masterpiece in itself.

,146410109,"PROS:

* Similar mechanics to DoS1: interactive world, where your ""combat"" abilities can often be used during non-combat to find alternative routes, complete puzzles and quests.
* Much improved world building and story. This isn't a story-telling masterpiece, but some moments and characters really stood out as memorable and good, which I can't say for the previous games. (except animals maybe)
* Finally, a RPG with turn-based combat system that doesn't assume I am a gambling addict and keep things tactical rather than letting the dice handle anything. 
* I like how source is translated from being a story device to be a very tangible gameplay element.
* Excellent sound track. (At least the main theme)

CONS:
* Combat feels more stale and repeatative. And yeah, some of this is related to getting rid of the RNG (which I praised) but I do think there are ways to achieve both. As is, the armour system is too binary. A character is either armoured and you can only do damage to it, or it has no armour and you can give it status effects like an imagantive kid playing with a doll.
* Less interesting puzzles. Most puzzles don't utilize the games' systematic design like they did in DoS1.
* I felt the game was too long. I was ready to be done with game by the beginning of act 4.",True

,144881977,"""Divinity: Original Sin 2 - An Epic Journey with a Mix of Fun and Frustration""

After an arduous and challenging journey, I can finally say I've conquered the tales of both DOS 1 and DOS 2. These classic cRPGs, renowned for their difficulty, presented me with an exhilarating adventure. While the sequel, DOS 2, upheld the tradition of greatness, it also introduced a slew of frustrations stemming from its game mechanics and design. The game boasts a captivating story, intriguing characters, and an enticing premise, but Larian Studios' unique and sometimes bewildering approach to progression leaves much to be desired. Recommending this game proves challenging, even to the most dedicated RPG aficionados. DOS 2 is a cumbersome cRPG that only the most hardcore or patient players will likely see through to the end.

Demanding yet Flawed Combat: DOS 2's combat system is undeniably tough and challenging, but it occasionally succumbs to cheese and imbalance. A more refined and evenly paced combat experience could have made it truly exceptional. The turn-based combat is clunky among all the RPGs, no real initiative based turn order, no turn tiling to pinpoint exactly where you will movement and non-aoe skills will land. Because of how the encounters are built around, you are always on the disadvantage as you always on most occasions start the battle bunched up close with each other, leaving the enemies to just freely nuke you with AOE debuffs and spells for free. If you plan to progress through the game, you have to learn to put up starting of alot of battle encounters on the backfoot. 

Solid Character Cast: The game does feature a diverse cast of characters and companions, although they may not be universally outstanding. While some shine brightly, others are merely decent, rather than extraordinary. Some characters I find overbearing and pretentious as well to be around, The Red Prince and Sir Lora's dialogue and story progression just leaves me more annoyed then enlightened due to their bloated posh overdoned snobby dialogue. Characters like Lohse, Sebille and Ifan are the more enjoyable ones by far.

Satisfying Conclusion: DOS 2 delivers a gratifying payoff at the end, providing players with a detailed explanation of their choices' consequences and the fate of the world of Rivellon, as well as the destiny of their companions.

Terrible Inventory System: One of the game's notable downsides is its incredibly tedious inventory system, which could have been streamlined for a more user-friendly experience. Thank God the weight limit mechanic in the game is very forgiving. I cannot imagine playing the game with this disastrous inventory system with an encumbered mechanic,

Modding Potential: On the bright side, the game offers decent modding capabilities, allowing players to tailor their experience and experiment with various balancing mods to suit their preferences.

Vague Quest Progression: My biggest pet peeve in the game, ne of the most frustrating aspects of DOS 2 is its extremely vague quest progression. Players often find themselves casting specific spells or combining them based on cryptic, non-existent information. Resorting to alt-tabbing to consult a guide after spending half an hour fruitlessly wandering around, making zero progress, is the opposite of enjoyable gameplay. 

In summary, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is an epic RPG adventure that combines moments of exhilarating fun with frustrating challenges. Its captivating story, diverse characters, and satisfying conclusion make it worth the journey for dedicated RPG fans, but its unrefined combat, clunky inventory system, and enigmatic quest progression can be off-putting for alot of people. It is one thing to play the game, it's another different story to see the game until the end. Ultimately, it's a game that rewards patience and perseverance but may not be everyone's cup of tea. I wished I had a middle of the road of option of reviews on Steam, because this game is the very epitome of acquired taste, you either like it enough to play through the game to the end or absolutely hate its guts.",True

,146194585,"Seriously one of the best games ever made. There's not much I can add that hasn't been said by others before me, but I feel compelled to add a positive review to this game after turning it into my most-played game on Steam, as well as after my recent disappointment behind Baldur's Gate 3. Playing the latter left such a sour taste in my mouth, and coming back to DOS2 instantly filled me with renewed euphoria. It's just so damn fun to play!

Now, I'll be honest and say that I don't care much for the story and most characters. It's well written and voice acted, I don't think it's bad, but I'm not really invested in any of it. I actually think there's some cool stuff in the setting, but the moment-to-moment story and plot development leaves me feeling indifferent.

However, for me, it's all about the gameplay. DOS2 provides such a compelling formula for turn-based combat that works so damn well in online coop which I simply cannot get in any other game, CRPG or otherwise. There are plenty of people who might argue for the strengths of games like Planescape: Torment or the OG Baldur's Gate titles but, for me, those are basically unplayable, especially today.

That said, the well of DOS2 eventually dried up even for me a few years ago. I'd done half a dozen playthroughs with friends, seen every ability and every fight. Even ""challenge"" playthroughs didn't really offer much novelty and ended up incomplete. For this reason, I ended up looking for mods that would offer substantial improvements, or at least a change in pace.

Enter Epic Encounters. What a beast of a mod. DOS2 is a fantastic game, baseline, but with EE on top of it I think it genuinely becomes the single best turn based game ever made. Nothing even comes close to it. The list of EE's changes and additions is extensive and, admittedly, it'd be terrible for new players. The sheer volume of systems is overwhelming even for a veteran. But with a bit of patience and learning, it opens up oceans of depth and incredible build variety that makes you crave your next campaign when you're not even halfway through your current one. It's easily added over 200 hours of playtime so far and I anticipate at least another one or two hundred more as I keep on going. All the while, I remain baffled by how much more fun I'm having than I ever did in BG3. Jesus christ.

In short, I can do naught but wholeheartedly recommend DOS2. If you have any interest in CRPGs or turn-based games, do yourself a favor and pick this up. Do a campaign or two and, if you find yourself getting bored, try Epic Encounters for what I consider the ultimate turn-based RPG experience.",True
,146192325,"Just get it. I won't presume to know what makes you happy, but I presume this game with make you happy.",True
,146186803,"I heard about DOS2 a few years ago and everyone was raving about it so I bought it. I played about 10 hours and got stuck and quit. Fast forward to Aug 2023, Baldur's Gate 3 comes out and I'm completely immersed, beating the game at about 150+ hrs and decided I need to revisit DOS2.

I came to realize I was playing DOS2 wrong at the time, I was playing it like a typical modern RPG with a linear story and progression, it's not uncommon to run into difficulty spikes in DOS 2 but that's beauty of this game. You have the freedom to go literally wherever you want or complete whatever quest whenever you'd like. If you get stuck, go work on another quest, gain a few levels, and come back. Baldur Gate 3 and DOS2 really challenges players' expectation from most modern games.

Anyways, DOS2 is awesome, just finally finished Act 1 on a fresh playthrough at around 30+ hrs. It's almost like too-long of a game because I know I probably have another 100+ hrs to go if I want to finish the game and I certainly do.",True

Today I parked my butt and played Baldur's Gate 2. It's amazing considering it's been out for 20 years and I'm still playing it. This time, what I'm doing different is playing a a NG half orc fighter/cleric. I modded it, because I think it's lame that only single class fighters get grandmastery. It makes sense, kind of, but what's the point in dueling to a fighter if you can only put two pips into your weapon mastery. Especially in the second edition.

I got done with that at about eleven, and then started playing some Skyrim. Man, I used to love that game! I still do, it turns out. My lvl 59 char kicks so much ass!

Yea, I'm going to start writing journal entries in the review sections. I saw today the old ""nobody's gonna read this so I'm going to say I'm gay,"" and it got me thinking. My review is irrelevant.

,146118355,"It's a little harsh to give thumbs-down to such acclaimed game, but I'm not a RPG player, so my review is for those who are also not used to play this genre. I'm a strategy player and came here mostly due the turn-based battles.
However, after 4 hours playing I figured out that battles are highly not recommended. In the early game, the main character and playable NPC's are really week compared to all kinds of enemies, so if you're seeking battles, prepare yourself to have your butt kicked humiliatingly in every encounter. It doesn't take more than two turns for you to be smashed, so if anyone ask you for a fight, just runaway from them.
But that's not the worst for me. Despite being a open world, you have not so much freedom. There are many quests and missions available, very important to pass through the levels, and all of them can be completed in only one way - but you have no clue about how to do it.
So, in the end, completely lost, you have to search for walkthroughs, carefully following every step described to move the chains, or you will just make useless conversations all around. It's very frustrating to read a walkthrough from top to bottom to be able to keep going, I almost never had to do it while playing strategy games (RTS's, RTT's or turn-based's).
But...now that I just bought it and exceeded the 2h limit to get a reimbursement, I will restart a tactical mode splitting the screen with a meticulous walkthrough I found, hoping I can catch on and start to get fun.",False

,146109163,"I'm here because my potato pc cant run BG3. I'm curious and new to this genre.

I started on classic difficulty with the original character, not took that much for me to get use to the mechanics. It started clear, but still give the player so much freedom to choose. I didn't realize it already took me 30 hours, because i just finished first map (already pull some all-nighters xD).

This game is very immersive. so many things to explore, so many things to consider, so many hidden treasures and quests, so many 'wow' moments, so many unique/important characters, and the fact that every characters got voiced is amazing.

I also love the reward/punishment system, it gives you so many level of consequences so the progress isn't flat. (had to save every little progress and load back a couple times xD)

No bug so far, just fps drop in a magical space once. probably because of my potato pc :)

I think the cons is probably the fact that sometimes I cant fulfill my ocd xD I cant finish some of my quests because there is no description for quest-related items (I sold them ofc), and when the game progress to the next map, the previous side quest is archived. But I think that is also a part of the reward/punishment system.

Very enjoy the game so far, I'm just started and one time run is definitely not enough, I cant wait for more stories to come.

Graphics: I can just stop and stare at some of the scenes or landscape for minutes on end.
Music: The final boss battle brought out the childhood fun out of me. 
Performance: Very optimize. Never had problems with my 1080/i5.
Story: Game has different characters and in game choices that allows you to see the story in different perspectives.

,145376422,"A refreshingly complete game with a variety of impressive levels and deep customisation. The numerous weapons and other machine part combinations make for a wide variety of playstyles. Your AC's overall weight, its chosen boosters and the generator determine how quickly you move, how long you can fly, and how fast you can boost; your legs determine  jump height, each type having an unique property (reverse-joint legs spring high, tetrapods hover, tanks can drift).

Buying and testing new weapons as they become available is a lot of fun - everything feels and sounds great. The sound design is really outstanding. Yes, weapons are almost universally satisfying and impactful: but you will have to build intelligently and manage distance wisely in order to hit without being gunned down yourself. In order to reliably hit the stronger, more evasive enemies in the game, it will be important to watch your Fire Control System's red tracking reticle, and choose an FCS that quickly locks on in your preferred combat range. Some builds will tend to kite at range, and conserve energy for reactive quickboosts to evade, while others will assault boost aggressively into melee range.

The monstrously large bosses present some of the hardest difficulty spikes in the game, but they are fair; with time, each enemy seems easier to overcome. After slowly piecing together your personal AC, mastering its playstyle, and beating the bosses, returning to previous missions feels like a new experience. By my NG+ second playthrough, I felt like a speedrunner and greatly enjoyed racing through familiar stages in a destructive flurry. Getting good at this game feels amazing, and you will find yourself trivializing formerly hard enemies. This includes bosses that might have stumped you for hours, who you will likely crush with only moderately better equipment (but a smarter build and better skills). New missions and changes in NG+ add to what feels like a perfect difficulty curve for a second run.",True

9/10 on the newest entry in the lineup
Tbh, easiest one of the entire series, which isn't a bad thing however.  Hilarious reading over people getting filtered.  Imagine having an AC game where it aims for you and still failing.  It's a good amalgamation of FromSoft's lessons learned over the years combo'd with the old school AC formula.
Weapon balance can be a bit wonky, and streamlining of parts is understandable for newer players to jump in, but I wish there was still more in depth building and stats.  First entry into the new generation, so parts list is also a bit anemic, but every ""new"" generation's first entry suffers from that, and if the older games releases hold any water there'll be another 1 or 2 releases in the ""generation"" that'll perfect the system introduced in this gen and introduce way more parts.

,148244940,"Never played an Armored Core or mech game before but Armored Core VI quickly became one of my favourite games of all time and is my Game Of The Year 2023.

In terms of presentation, Armored Core VI is spectacular. Every single mech piece and weapon is designed with utmost painstaking detail, the vibrancy of particle effects from explosions, lasers, mech thrusters etc. beautifully contrasts the grim cities and desolate industrial landscapes of Rubicon 3, and every weapon sounds and feels powerful to fire due to fantastic sound design and the fast-paced visceral combat is accompanied by an amazing high octane soundtrack.

The gameplay loop of building mechs, testing their performance, readjusting your build, and completing missions to earn money to buy more mech parts is addictively fun. You can spend tens of hours in the garage alone meticulously fine tuning and customising your mech's performance and appearance without getting bored; just about every build is viable, though some builds will perform better depending on the mission you use them on. Sure, if you want to you can brute force your way through the vast majority of the game with a pair of shotguns and needle launchers or songbirds, but to me the most fun part of this game was experimenting with different mech builds and playstyles even if they weren't objectively the most powerful or optimal, they were simply fun. Unlike FromSoft's souls-style games where you spec into a specific build and are locked into using certain weapons until you re-spec, in this game you are highly encouraged to experiment with different builds because you can swap out parts or load entirely different saved builds on-the-go so the gameplay never gets boring and stale.

The two most surprising aspects of this game for me were the story and its characters. I didn't know what to expect from the story since this was my first Armored Core game, but considering this is a mech game I presumed that FromSoft would just prioritise gameplay over story. However, I was pleasantly surprised by just how much I became invested in the story, mystery and overall dilemma of the Coral and Rubicon 3's planetary corporate war. Supporting the story is the plethora of interesting and memorable characters throughout the game, which is impressive considering you never actually get to see what any of the characters looks like, you only get to see their emblem, sometimes their mech and hear their voice. Whether it's a major story character like Walter or a one-off hidden mech fight, each voice actor did an outstanding job at expressing their character and bringing them to life through their voice. I also liked how ambiguous each ending of the game was; there was no strictly good or bad ending, some factions and characters triumphed while others perished because of your actions and each ending made you question and reflect on the decisions you made throughout the game.

The only real complaint I have with this game is the horrendous Easy Anti-Cheat implementation. Just like Elden Ring, either FromSoft or Bandai Namco has yet again insisted on adding this useless resource hog of an 'anti cheat' into Armored Core VI on PC, so if you want to play PvP you have no choice but to deal with this invasive kernel-level, borderline malware piece of software running on your PC alongside the game and doing nothing but hampering the performance of an otherwise superbly optimised game. By running Armored Core VI directly via the exe and in offline mode I was able to play this game at 1440p on maxed out settings at a consistent 60fps with only occasional dips in performance during moments with tons of particles on screen at once. In contrast, running the game online with Easy Anti-Cheat on I would get frequent frustrating stutters that completely destroyed any potential enjoyment of the game. Personally I am more interested in the PvE side of the game rather than the PvP but nonetheless I should not have to launch the game directly via its exe and in offline mode just so I can play the single player PvE campaign at a stable framerate. It's a huge shame that Easy Anti-Cheat has once again ruined the online experience of another phenomenal FromSoft game and I hope they'll stop adding this detrimental digital garbage to their PC releases in the future.

I've played quite a few of FromSoft's souls games so I knew how imaginative and intriguing their worlds and stories are, but somehow I did not expect the same writing quality in a mech game. Thankfully, I was proven wrong and FromSoft have yet again made an absolute masterpiece of a game that I cannot get enough of. I hope this game has sold well enough to warrant a DLC or even a sequel in the future because this game has clearly proven that FromSoft doesn't need to solely develop souls-style games and can branch out and experiment with their game design.

Overall, I cannot recommend Armored Core VI enough despite the performance issues caused by Easy Anti-Cheat, this game is an absolute masterpiece.",True

,144960698,"Updating my review after completing NG++. Old review kept below for my thoughts after the first playthrough.

High 7/10 overall. 

To start with the good:
- It is EXTREMELY pretty. The slow-mo's when you take down big enemies is fantastic, I have taken many many many screenshots. 
- The vs AC fights are SO SO SO FUN. I have yet to dip my toes into multiplayer at this stage but the story fights are at their best when the enemy is 'just' another AC. 
- Customisation shines after the first playthrough, when you have options to work with. I can't compare it to past games myself. TIP: try out super-fast lightweight builds, and slow tank builds. Once I figured out what worked for me, it was really fun to stomp most missions!

Now for the bad. YMMV obviously, this is just my take. 
Some of the bosses are just... not very fun to fight. Personally, I put it down to fighting AC-sized enemies that have none of the restrictions you have. Hyper-manoeuvrable machines that 2-shot you are just not very fun to fight. Not all bosses are like this; the cavalry are cool and I've grown to enjoy fighting them.

To conclude, this game has started a fascination with the mecha genre. I've watched a few seasons of Gundam after starting Armored Core. Time to go back and play some of the older games. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OLD REVIEW BELOW:

Lightly recommended --- 6~7/10. This will be a slight stream of consciousness style one but I'll try to keep it coherent. To put it to a sentence: I'm not a huge fan of the design philosophy here --- the main missions are easy, but the bosses are ridiculous.

To start off with the good: it is spectacular. The (good) guns feel weighty and the audiovisual design is on point. When things are running, they absolutely go hard.

My main issues with the game are that the bosses aren't so much a difficulty jump as a difficulty spike. They are jarring to fight against, and (at least personally, I know I know skill issue) required an amount of what felt like cheese to beat. 
Were the fights spectacular? Sure. 
Did I also feel like ""finally I can get on with the game"" when I beat them? Heck yeah I did. 

This feels like an extremisation of Elden Ring's boss design philosophy, which I don't think is a good thing since the context is entirely different. There are no i-frames in AC6, which is fine. However a lot of bosses have chip damage (swarms of missiles). That would also be fine, except this almost guarantees you'll get staggered then one- or two-shot by a big attack. That just ain't fun to me. 

My issues extend also to a couple enemy designs. The largest issue I had were the shield enemies. They were fine in small numbers, even fun since they presented a different challenge. But one mission throws you into an arena with almost no cover, throws swarms of them at you with support, and just doesn't stop. You either counter the swarms and get screwed over by the couple of large enemies that spawn + boss, or you counter the big guys and get swarmed. This mission felt a lot more like luck than skill. 

All in all, I feel like the design philosophy here was somewhat conflicted, or at least I don't enjoy it as much as I hoped. I feel like if they had focussed on maybe longer, more attrition style missions with interesting small enemy encounters, that would have been really good. There's a couple of these missions in the game, and when they hit the mark they are fantastic.",True

My favourite generation in particular being 3, Silent Line and Last Raven as they seem to have the right atmosphere, feel, variety of gameplay and story - essentially to me they are peak Armored Core.  6 though ... 6 is what the ten year old playing the first one always wanted, to blast around like in the intro cinematics and feel like an actual Mech God.  This game is for me, the best Armored Core I've ever played and the fact and to say that I was not expecting another game in this franchise is an understatement.  FromSoft improved on the AC formula exponentially here and whilst I understand I have my own fanboi service biases, I cannot fault the game to any major degree.  The sound design is brilliant, the story and writing is fantastic, the mechanics are buttery smooth, the attention to detail is incredible.

1.04 Patch has broken the game for me. Game constantly crashes. 9/10 times the game crashes when launching. I'm lucky if I can get past ""Press to Continue"" before the game hangs up and crashes.

Ignoring this minor hiccup, this is an excellent game that won't be for everyone. Bosses are hard and gate-keep progress, unlike Elden Ring, which lets you go around. A few of these bosses took days of selling off parts and trying out new strats with different legs to either tank my way through a fight or reverse joint legs to jump, boost, dodge and dodge some more and barely scrape by. Second play-thru? Bosses become easy and the new skill check becomes the 1v3 AC battles. If you do not like having to adapt your playstyle constantly, this game will be very frustrating. If you like overcoming the challenge, this game will test your mettle.

,148190782,"On its own feet this is an awesome game. It is my first in the series.

It is a lot of good ol' fashioned fun. The story while unclear and muddy at first becomes more and more engaging through NG+ and NG++ as you get the alternative endings and start piecing things together. In typical FromSoft fashion there are many questions I don't have answered but I felt seeing all 3 endings left me sufficiently satisfied.

The combat is fast and the missions are well paced. Generally missions are quick but with substance; they simply do NOT drag on forever. In fact, some are just boss fights which I personally love. There are longer missions but the check-pointing system was well done in the spirit of keeping the pace going. The customisation options are great and all the weapons feel good. Having just played through NG, NG+, NG++ and S-Ranking all the missions, I haven't burnt out yet (surprisingly) even if I am a bit tired.

Is it perfect? (Is any game?) Of course not. The game can be both really difficult or really easy at the same time; confusing I know. But basically it comes down to if you build your AC appropriately for the encounter/mission. The campaign difficulty curve was good for base NG playthrough, especially for first timer to the series.

There are builds that can trivialise some (read that as almost all) encounters once you starting getting into NG+ onwards and S-Ranking missions (I'm looking at you Zimmerman shotgun). And it is unfortunately easy to fall into the trap of sticking to that one build when/if you discover it. It can still be satisfying but those looking for a real challenge or a variety of builds for each mission might find disappointment IF they fall into that trap of sticking to a single build and optimising the fun out of the game.

The great thing is, is that I found that so many (if not all) of the weapons are fun and effective if used CORRECTLY and in combination with other appropriate weapons. You just have to make the decision to try them. Fortunately everything you buy from the shop buys and sells at the same price, and so your money is more of a 'budget'. Buy and sell freely and try all the weapons. You'll love it.

In either case you are certainly going to get your money's worth. I am looking forward to any potential future expansions to this, or a sequel.

I also am really glad to have discovered Armored Core and knowing nothing about the previous titles, I feel like I have become a new fan!",True

,148172776,"I recommend anyone to try this game, regardless of experience with the genre or specifically this series. 
 Keep in mind as I go a little more detail this may be the bias talking as someone who has played Armored Core since the first game way back on the Playstation:

This game is about as good as it gets for the mecha genre.  A great balance of having to consider the engineering of the parts behind your mech and exhilarating, anime-esque combat that really tests your ability to react to situations and your thought process to guide your builds accordingly.  Some missions demand certain build considerations, which can feel limiting at time but does encourage you to try out different ideas behind not just your build but your play style as well.  The controls do take some getting use to but they are ultimately straight-forward in their implementation.  The story is bleak, a staple of FromSoftware's titles, and makes you consider that no one is the ""good guy"" in a universe run by corporations and where mercenary activity is commonplace.  Even with multiple endings, its hard to feel like anyone is coming out on top ultimately. Graphically, this is the best the series has ever looked.  It still may look rough or lifeless at a first glance, but it's a reflection of the world you find yourself in.

The biggest draw though has to be the level of customization for your Armored Core mech.  Not only do you have access to a large variety of parts with different attributes to suit how you want to play, you can lose hours to the visual customization as well.  The colors of your AC along with the ability to add create emblems and decals with a surprisingly robust in-game image creation tool, then apply them anywhere on your AC leads to a truly personalized machine for you.

The biggest turn-off for some players, however, may be the spikes in difficulty.  Bosses are relentless and do not give you room to breathe.  You need to constantly be on the move and keeping your eyes glued to the visual cues coming from your HUD letting you know when something particularly dangerous is coming your way.  You need to find the weaknesses in how they attack and respond accordingly.  While some bosses can be extremely difficult, the feeling of relief after a particularly intense fight can feel genuinely real.

I have seen lots of veterans of the series deriding the simplified assembly process, saying that it's too toned-down from the complex engineering games like Armored Core 4/for Answer where you even had to consider the balance of your mech.  I can appreciate the love for the deep, problem solving mentality that is encouraged by the older games, however a simplification does not mean that it's gone entirely, it's just applied differently.  It's hard to describe this in particular, but I don't feel restricted by the simplification.  If anything, it gives me even more freedom to build the AC I want to pilot.

Multiplayer, as of the time of this writing, is a mixed bag.  Some builds are clearly more effective than other, so much like many build-based multiplayer experiences, you will be expected to learn a metagame to have the best chance of emerging victorious.  Balance patches are starting to come, but it remains to be seen if they will be effective in the long run.  While the meta experience can hurt your individuality, it is also a great source of desire to make your personal build work against it.

Overall, I think this is the best Armored Core has ever been.  If you're looking for a challenging game with a high level of customization for both your mech in terms of both appearance and play style, you're going to have a great time.",True

I was seeing posts about ""filter"" and ""git gud"" and thought it was going to be a souls-like game I wasn't going to enjoy. It is extremely fun. I wouldn't recommend it to people who want to progress to a game without struggle, but if you embrace the struggle there is no better feeling than beating that challenging boss or mastering a system. This was one of the first Souls-like games I enjoyed, all the other ones (except for Sekiro) felt like the rhythm of battle was ""I attack, then you attack, then I attack, then you attack"", which I personally don't enjoy.

I'll admit initially I was feeling bored of playing the game since I was using the same AC and specs through the beginning. What turned it around for me was that I watched a video of what the specs mean. I don't remember anything from that video, but it did change how I think about building my mech. I was no longer trying to go from combat to combat with the same build (or to find one that was over powered), I was willing to farm to buy all the items in the store and try them out. You don't have to do this to have fun though. It's just how I had fun in this game. I know some people who are absolute Chads and fought with just pistols and swords, and Chad supremes who fought with just their fists. I applaud them for their mastery of the game, but I wouldn't have found that play style fun.

Anyways I never mastered this game, I never found an OP build, but I still had fun. Even on the ending I chose I was fumbling with my fingers on the boss, and I still came up on top. It was fun.

,148158625,"The most underrated game of 2023.

I want to clarify this is my first AC title ever. All I knew beforehand was that it's made by FromSoftware, and that it's about mechs. I also went in completely blind.

After my first playthrough, which considering extended idle times bc I didn't want to lose my checkpoint ran for about 30 hrs, I must say I was completely blindsided by this game. The first few stages, it wasn't grabbing me, I found the stages to be a bit underwhelming, graphics also a bit underwhelming (This game is nowhere near as pretty as Elden Ring btw), and while the action combat and customization gameplay was fun, I must admit I was kinda missing souls combat. 

However, all of this changed once I passed the first 2 chapters. Suddenly I found myself wrapped up in a mystery I did not expect. I found myself caring for characters that you never see, people that you only hear, who are never given a face. At most you get an emblem, a title, and a designation. I found myself scouring levels for any log or data I could find, in order to understand more of what was happening.

I never expected any of this. I came for a solid action game with mechs, explosions and customization options. And yes, it definitely has all of that, combat is fast paced, incredibly fun, super action packed, very easy to pick up and understand. Boss fights are interesting. There's a world of unparalleled scale here, where everything seems impossibly large, to the point normal cars and buildings look like toys, and factories are so unbelievably large you can't help but wonder what their purpose even is. Every encounter can be approached in a different manner, and it's simple to change your mech on the fly to try sth else at a particularly difficult fight. All of this is there, and it's good.

However, while I came expecting all of that, I ended up being enthralled by the story and the characters. I got more attached to characters in this game than anyone in a horizon game, FFXVI, or god of war, to put a few examples. All I want now is to do the other endings just to find out the destiny of this planet and its denizens. I honestly can't believe how much of a masterpiece of weird storytelling this game is, and if you're willing to listen, you can get hooked by that too. If you can leave the explosions and the fire behind for a minute, you'll find a different core to this game than you'd believe. It also helps that this game doesn't really hide its narrative like other From titles do, it's all there, quite readily accessible.

As a few final notes, the music has some truly amazing moments, and the visuals, while more on the discreet side, sometimes come together to create some truly insane scenarios, in what is quite a unique aesthetic. The game also isn't that difficult, and if you want you can look up good builds for every encounter, you'll win easily. Performance on my mid-high end machine (4070ti/12700f) was excellent throughout, played at native 4k with everything at max except RT which for some reason crashed the game.

Give this game a chance. For me this is an easy 9/10, and I'd advise to not believe any reviewers who say there isn't a story here. I think AC6 is easily at the same tier as Bloodborne, Dark Souls 1 and Sekiro are, and I'm very glad I decided to stick with a game I thought was a bit disappointing at first.",True

Game is great, gameplay is good, the balance is now good. my only criticisms are I'm so tired of the voice acting calling you 'tourist' every 5 seconds. The mission biomes could be more varied, would have loved a few jungle missions. Major gripe though is I'm ultra tired of developers doing this NG+++++++++ shit, just work more on the actual game and don't tell the story through 3 playthroughs and repetitive bullshit that wastes the players time. give me everything once, and then let the player decide if they want a hard reset. Overall great game, I found the full RI build with mid tier laser rifles and laser turrets to be OP in both the campaign and multiplayer, area denial is huge. I really only had to change build a few times in campaign. works great for 1v1. 3v3 is entirely different though and I'm still trying things, impact and detonation area or even light weight builds can all play into a team, not really digging the tank builds though most of the ultra heavy weapons are easy to miss with and I would prefer mobility every time. 




PSA: If you are not one shotting the tutorial boss and are spending ""90min-5hrs"" on it then you need to go to your doctor and get checked for missing chromosomes.

AC6 is one of the most basic bitch shit ive played in years, its really easy.....did any of you even play Elden Ring?!!! same dev and dramatically less fucks were given. 

if you are too dumb to play this game dont give it a negative review, return it and play something like stardew valley or hogwarts legacy....they design games for kids....dave the diver too......

Edit: 
sea spider was ultra bullshit imo as well. 

The other bosses' people were complaining about I found were easy for me but sea spider was hard mainly because of the extreme constant damage and HUGE aoe on the slam attack. 

Most Elden ring bosses had a level of finesse.....
I beat every single boss and all secret bosses in Elden ring. Sea spider felt like it was not tuned and had WAYYYYY too much hit points and random un-dodgeable fire to be considered a masterwork. 

for this boss you basically have to spec into all stun with the pile driver, thats what worked for me but you also have to get the right RNG roll too on its attacks. there were a few times I would get it dont to second phase and the thing would literally glitch fly into the ceiling wayyyyy above flying range and not come down. keep in mind this was with boosters on a medium mech build. the boss just feels half baked. great game overall so far but I dont want to have to replay and farm missions for parts just to face these bosses that have a gimmick build and strat. build them more dynamic.",True

I love using the 4 legs and hovering around the battlefield. However, it doesn't always work against the faster mechs, so I have to use either tank build, or a reverse joint build.

,148127659,"Armored Core 6 is a game that you're going to love if you're a certain type of person. I happen to be that kind of person and enjoyed my experience very much.

[b]In this review I will discuss what the game is and isn't, to help you make an informed decision.[/b]

The core activity loop of this game is:
-you go on relatively short missions (5 minutes on average?) to earn money
-you spend money on new mech parts
-you use the mech parts to tinker with your build, to complete missions more efficiently

The activities feed into one another in a satisfying circulation, and the fact that parts can be sold at full value really encourages wild experimentation with assemblies, which is easily one of the main strengths of the game.

The parts the game provides have tremendous impact on gameplay variety of your build, probably most easily felt in case of weapons and legs. For legs, the opposite extremes you are provided is either being an unstoppable armored tread vehicle, a bombardment aircraft, or a lightning fast grasshoper, impossible to aim at as long as piloted competently. There are a lot of playstyle niches being satisfied and made viable, so you are likely to find something that will suit you in particular.

The parts provided are mostly balanced to be on equal footing, each shining in different circumstances, meaning that if a part feels useless, it's most likely because your build is not suited for utilizing it well. [b]That is one of the major things that could potentially turn people away[/b]: the game will require you to tinker a lot if you want to have a decent time piloting your machine. It is relatively easy to put together an unplayable heap of garbage that will make the game unnecessarily difficult if you're not paying enough attention to the assembly process. You are required to at least somewhat enjoy both the action gameplay part and the tinkering part of the game to have an overall good time.
That being said, the campaign is very lenient when it comes to build optimization, and bruteforcing your way through the game with a mediocre build is perfectly doable - you will just need to put in extra work in dexterity department. Which is to say, your skill will need to increase over time either in raw mechanics of the game or the build-making aspect, but you can somewhat neglect one for the other. That also means that you can look up highly optimal builds online and make the game trivial, which I highly advise against - figuring out the game's intricacies as you go is big part of the fun.

In terms of difficulty, this is the easiest FromSoft game I've played. I've hit about two difficulty walls in my first NG cycle, each requiring me to learn to play significantly better and preparing me for the rest of things to come. After the second difficult encounter, the game was never difficult again and I breezed through it, including also NG+1 and NG+2 campaigns. Now that I've both learned to play better mechanically and know how to build pretty good mechs, the campaign missions are trivial, especially since enemy balance in NG+ cycles stays the same.
That's okay though, because the true post-game content is the PvP. It seems that the online space is populated mostly by people who stuck with the game, which mostly means hardcore fans, very competent at the game, so prepare to spend many matches getting completely destroyed before getting any footing in the mode. The 3v3 team deathmatch mode seems like a good and fun way to get eased in into the world of PvP.

The game's feel is very polished, the mechs always feel very good to control. The presentation and feedback are consistent, you can always tell what just happened and strategize what to do about that. The game follows the FromSoft tradition of putting art direction over fidelity, and once again it works. The sound design is very competent, a lot of the sounds are properly satisfying to listen to. The music is serviceable, a bit below usual FromSoft standards, but still featuring some stand outs. The story is serviceable, very predictable at times but also has some genuinely good moments - it's a very mixed bag of the great, the bad and the mediocre. At the same time, I don't think the story is anywhere near being the main focus of the game, so it's fine.

Minor things to note that you might or might not like:
-the missions, while decently varied thanks to some gimmicks here and there, tend to boild down to ""clean up basic grunts"", especially if there is no boss around. It might be mindless fun for some, but boring and tedious to others.
-the balance is, at least currently, very skewed against very long range builds. If you want to live a sniper fantasy, it's going to be an uphill battle
-you need to complete at least 3 NG cycles (NG, NG+1, NG+2) to be done with the game's content, but on the other hand the campaign is pretty short, completing all 3 in under 30 hours is reasonably doable

Long story short, I recommend AC6 if you are looking for a game that is fast paced, highly customizable and not too difficult. The gameplay is fun right from the get go, and the bite-sized mission length lets you play it even when you don't have much time available to spend in one sitting.",True
,147347453,"If you like Fromsoft games this is worth a shot if you can afford it.

The game achieves it's main goal of reintroducing the Armored Core Series to people unfamiliar, given the success of Elden Ring.

The difficulty kinda plateaus after Balteus but given the combat system Fromsoft created i don't think they could have made it more difficult without being unfair.

I was having second thoughts after realizing that this was a Fromsoft game (with my relatively bad experiences playing Sekiro), but I chanced upon my friend playing this game and decided I should give it a try again.

45 hours in and I can safely say I have no regrets. The game was very enjoyable and fun with the difficulty not being over-tuned (sometimes I got frustrated and decided to cheese my way through some bosses) but all in all I can say I enjoyed the whole process of learning and finding an AC build that fits my playstyle.

,147607922,"I can now 100% understand why some people hate this game so much and find it very frustrating. My playthrough in the game was either good or bad because I was either stuck on a boss where they would just spam nearly 90% of what they would have in their aresenal. Some bosses I found to be pretty balanced while some I found to be utterly stupid having to rely on rng to determine what the bosses will do, it isn't fun also having to fight a boss where you need to rely on specific builds to play the game in order to progress the game. I've done all the endings in the game so don't give me the ""git gud"" crap I actually took my time trying to learn the boss patterns and I can for sure say it's disorienting as hell for your eyes trying to follow the boss sometimes.

The customization is very confusing when you're building your AC because the descriptions can be misleading sometimes and don't really point out the small detailed specifics. I had to watch 3 different videos to understand what was what like I was in a lecture trying to learn a damn subject. But I finally got the hang of understanding how to build your AC properly and ever since then I've been making fun builds. I love making builds but honestly the UI is just too much to look at with your eyes if you're a new player.

EAC is the worst possible anti cheat ever to even exist because of its known issues to cause games to break. I cannot stress enough over not being able to play multiplayer when I need to turn on EAC in my files, it simply is just annoying going back in forth changing the names of the files and turning off cpu 0 in task manager. All I wish for is if they can damn release a patch goddammit already it's been a month and they still haven't fixed it at all, I hate the stuttering and the only fix is what I basically said above in my first sentence.

I loved and hated the game which is a balance for me but I would've loved the game if it was a little better imo.

Collecting gear is fun and they implemented good customization, which can be taken to the extreme with the decal editor. Bosses are reminiscent of Souls bosses but feel way less intimidating because you're blasting dual miniguns and a hailstorm of rockets at them! I haven't found a game where I just shredded through missions without even a thought of a break, and as soon as I beat the campaign I just started over not even really knowing there's more to do in following playthroughs!

But the game itself doesn't play very nicely.

There is a bug or something that causes low fps and stuttering on older cpus. A work-around for this exists by running the game without anti-cheat and then disabling and re-enabling core-0 on the process - every time you start the game.

Graphics have an excessively high contrast and visual noise which does not lend itself to fast-paced gameplay.  

Audio likewise is overloaded and difficult to discern. 

The HUD is not good: everything is indicated by identical thin, monochromatic lines which shake all over the screen.

There is a weird stagger mechanic which renders many builds non-viable as they do no meaningful damage. It also allows the player to be completely stun-locked to death. 

Gameplay basically devolves into continuously strafing, dodging, and either holding or mashing 4 different attack buttons, as you wait for the enemy to die (or your ammo to run out). 

In addition to parts being unlocked, they must also be purchased. You can refund purchased parts for 100% of the purchase price. So, all purchases are meaningless and this system only makes it more cumbersome and annoying to change loadouts.

""New-game+ is better"", they say.  I don't think so. I enjoyed it much more during my first 10 hours, or at least up until that boss at the end of chapter 1.

There are some nice visuals at least, as you long as you stop moving long enough to process them.",False

After playing a recent game that also recently came out with a similar system of perfect paries, I was drawn again to Sekiro. These last 50 hrs were some of the best gameplay hours that I have had. Knowing that all the fights can be beat in a fair manner once you learn the combat system kept me going. Yes at first I was trash, but once it clicks it clicks.

,147961205,"This is my first time playing a FromSoft game, and I did not expect it to turn out to be one of my favorite games of all time. Dying had never been so fun.

Sekiro’s bosses/minibosses are designed in a way that dying to them made me feel a frustration that’s motivational rather than annoying (maybe except for a few like Demon of Hatred and the apparition types lol). The bosses are difficult but fair in the sense that whenever I die, I either learn something about the enemies’ movesets or realize what I’m not doing right yet, so on the next try I have an idea about how to improve. When you start to consistently execute the correct actions, the effect it has on the bosses is immediately apparent. I also used to dislike stealth, but this game showed me that my universal grudge against stealth was unjustified. In Sekiro, stealth can turn impossible fights against hoards of enemies into manageable and enjoyable boss encounters. In fact being able to one-hit deathblow many mobs in a row while grappling/hiding around the environment really do be making you feel like a ninja sometimes lol. Here I have to mention that the sound effects in Sekiro are absolutely INCREDIBLE and play a vital role in making the gameplay extremely satisfying.

Not just the combat, the story and character/world building are also amazing. These were done through a combination of cutscene animations + optional dialogues with NPCs and item descriptions. The way they depicted [spoiler]the sculptor’s fate hit me particularly hard… After seeing Ashina set into chaos upon Isshin’s death and knowing what has become of the sculptor, I went back to the dilapidated temple to only see a lone log of wood in the middle of the room, and Wolf goes on to fix his prosthetic arm by himself... There was no direct exposition of the sculptor’s suffering, but the scene hit harder than if there were. (And connecting this to what happens to Wolf in the Severance ending… *wails*)[/spoiler] Despite the fairly straightforward main plot, there are many small details and optional story content like this to discover, which makes the characters and lore much richer than it may first appear to be.

I guess the only minor complaint I have is the dragonrot mechanic, which sounds intimidating at first but kind of quickly turns into a trivial punishment that doesn't really do much besides making you feel bad about causing NPCs to suffer (until you heal them after defeating a boss).",True

The sound of a deflection is so perfect that I've lost sleep simply imagining it. Every boss is both brutally punishing and trivially easy at the same time depending on how much of their playbook you've learnt. And that in essence is the journey in Sekiro: you learn the playbook for each enemy until you're the boss.

Getting good at this game was naturally not very easy, but the game clicked for me at Genichiro and I haven't been able to put it down since. The art design and music are tasteful and atmospheric and there are some truly spectacular moments in the game, but the real spectacle is always in the boss fights as you rip your way through a boss' posture bar and land that sweet deathblow on them. 

The combat in this game feels so unbelievably polished that you never have an excuse for a loss. A lesser game would hand you ten losses and you'd blame the game for just being total BS, but not in Sekiro. You step back, take a break, and try again. And again. And again. Until that brick wall crumbles and the light starts to shine through.

But I am not sure if I should actually recommend this game as it is really much harder than  the Souls games.
I was about to quit when I simply could not beat the central boss about 1/3 in the game. I worked on that for about 20-30 hours, maybe even more. Way more than on any Souls boss.

Leveling up is also very tedious. - A boss victory gives you maybe 10% of the needed XP as every new skill requires several skill points, each requiring 100+ kills (without getting killed yourself) very soon in the game.

To be honest I ""quit"" on the Owl fight, enabling a mod for just receiving 50% damage. And it was still no walk in the park finishing the game.
But I think I might start another run without that help...

[b] Game mechanics [/b]

This game compels you to learn the game mechanics or die trying, This game has arguably the best mechanics souls game has ever had for me. 

Compared to other souls game like Elden ring or Dark Souls 3, I feel like the mechanics are much more refined. For example the parry in other souls game is a joke. Sekiro has a far better definition of mechanics. Its a pure skill based game. In other souls game you can only dodge the incoming attacks for the most part or use there ill time framed unsatisfying parry. Not only that, Sekiro has various different forms of parrying like jumping or mekiri counter that has to be chosen appropriately based on the enemies attack.

[b] Boss Fights [/b]

The bosses in Sekiro are designed beautifully. Various versions of the same bosses with different skill set can only be found in this game. Every single boss that you fight inevitably makes you suffer. But once you have mastered the art of fighting in this game. You become unstoppable.

[b] Game design [/b]

Along with all this, you get to experience the beauty of this game through the game play. From the Ashina castle to the fountainhead palace, every single area of this game was designed to keep you satisfied. 

I only wish that they had launched an expansion pack or something to keep this game alive. I'm just hoping they will someday.

You're a Shinobi that hides in the Shadows and if you keep that in Mind, you wont have trouble. First snack the Foe's around the Miniboss and then assassinate him. 

Do not hesitate in a Boss fight, even when a Boss first seems to be overwhelming keep the aggro up, learn the attack pattern and find your Moments to sneak an attack in. 

Listen to the sounds of the blades jamming against each other, once you got the rhythm you never gonna miss. 

Use your prosthetic to create windows for your attacks.

Only thing that bothers me a bit that there are multiple enemies that doesn't wield a sword because the most satisfying boss fights are those against blades.

This is by far the most rewarding combat system I saw in a Game.

At the end, I have to say it. Git gud, try to learn and you will have one blast of an experience.

From the basic things such as attack cancelling, input buffering, deflections and movement to the different combat arts and the prosthetic tools, all of them feel like they work together extremely well and feel very fluid and fun to use. Deflections are crucial to this game. A deflection is when you block at the moment an attack lands. It requires some skill but with a little practice you can do them consistently. If you do it right, you hear a loud clang sound and a visual cue which is great feedback. This makes it a very refreshing and satisfying mechanic that feels great to pull off every single time. Then you have the posture system which is very unique and a new take on melee combat with a surprising amount nuance and depth. I could ramble on for hours about each aspect, whether the music, lighting or writing and dialogue. Most fun i've had with a game in a while.

No other game gives me nearly as much of an adrenaline and dopamine rush after overcoming each boss while learning their moveset over time. It builds a steady rhythm and eventually you can see attacks coming once you've familiarized with said rhythm. Trial and error is your best friend in this.

Edit after 100 hours of play: So this has been the most fun game I've played in years probably, so fun in fact I ended up having problems with my wrists cause of playing it so much :(
The fast paced combat, good difficulty curve and challenge, reasonably good controls (safe for the usualy camera being sometimes a bit wonky), fun secondary abilities and gadgets to play around with all makes it a great experience even for multiple playthroughs.
There's multiple endings and you won't see some of the content on your first playthrough most likely, since there's also some hidden stuff. Now over one year after release we get some extra content on top as well.

Unfortunately it doesn't come without the usual fromsoft flaws: The ""patented"" infinite input buffer where moves come out 5 seconds after input if you got interrupted the first time and then will get you killed without being able to do anything.
Along with the bad wakeup moves that turn some enemy combos into one shots, because if you get hit by the first move and get stunned or knocked down, even if you press to get up faster, you can't really input anything else before getting hit again and if you lay down and don't get up you also get hit, which makes one wonder why the fast getup moves even exist to begin with. Similar with the ""getting out of stunned pose"", where you can ""get out of stun"" by pressing dodge, but then just enter a just as long other animation where Sekiro uselessly hold up one arm in front of him and also doesn't accept any inputs anymore.

It's still a very fun game overall, but expect the usual flaws and frustrations
",True
,147856008,"This is hands down the best souls game, if you're mostly interested in combat. It is somewhat different from the Dark Souls series and Elden Ring, in the sense that you mostly parry here, which is the most satisfying game mechanic ever. Also you can't overlevel and the toolkit to beat every boss is fairly basic, so every fight is really well made and tailored around the kit that you have. Played Elden Ring and some encounters were really boring or frustating. On Sekiro each and every one is awesome, and the perfect amount of ""hard"" for you to conquer it. The only exception here is DoH, that is essentially a Dark Souls boss on Sekiro, and it doesn't fit at all and is a pain in the ass to get through. However combat wise, this is the best a fromsoft game has to offer and it makes every win feel like you mastered the encounter and you are the boss now.

On the other hand, exploration isn't hugely open world, like ER, but there are some shortcuts and different paths for players to choose. For me personally, I loved what Sekiro had to offer without it becoming tedious. There are a lot distinct locations, and the locations that you revisit have a good enough twist every time to keep them interesting. However don't expect the huge content of ER, although it took me around 40 hours to explore most of the game, while on ER it took me 90 to explore a fair amount. So there is enough things to explore, but the main focus are the bosses.

Now, the fact that you can't overlevel and don't have RPG elements is what made me love this game. You can't really make a fight easier. You just have to punch a wall, over and over again, till you break it down and that's the main difference here, and for me that's what makes the game amazing. The feeling I got after beating each boss here is the feeling I got while beating Margit on ER the first time, and Malenia. But not other bosses. Sekiro is just the perfect amount of challenge every time.

It's the best game I have played, but that's because of the challenge. So if you are interested in that, pick it up immediatelly.

Once you get the hang of it no other souls born combat system comes close to making you feel as bad ass as Sekiro does. 

I have herd people critique that the lack of weapons and class system makes for a horrendous lack of variety. Couldn't disagree more as the shinobi prosthetic and combat arts do the trick just fine for me at least. That being said, most players won't experiment with these options to much on their first play through as it requires you to have a good grasp of the combat in order to know when and how to use these optional tools, and new players are gonna be stressed just parrying and attacking let alone properly implementing these elements. When you do though, you feel like ur in an anime. Which is actually being made rn from what I hear (:

This is my favourite souls like game by a good margin. Would recommend to anyone. Just know that sekiro expects you to play the game how it wants to be played and not how you want to play it.

[u]Overall rating: 10/10[/u]

Sekiro is a third person action game from the makers of Dark Souls, set in Sengoku Japan. The game is a mix of stealth & action where you can silent kill most non-boss enemies but the bosses themselves require a direct confrontation. The game takes place in Japan during the 1500s and features some mythical elements to it as well.

The game features an amazing combat system in the form of ""posture"", which is like a second health bar that fills up when you block attacks (this applies to you and the enemies). Filled up posture will deplete over time if you stop blocking. While you can block almost every attack in the game (there are a few unblock-able attacks that require jumping/rolling), filling up your posture bar results in a temporary disorientation which can be fatal (damage is very high). On the flip side, attacking an enemy repeatedly allows you to fill their posture bar which can result in a deathblow for non-bosses and partial deathblow for bosses.

So you want to keep wailing on the enemy but also block/dodge when they counter you occasionally. A perfectly timed block (deflection) costs very little posture and allows you to keep going for longer.
This turns the game into a rhythm game where the ""clangs"" of swords tell you when to time your blocks (non block-able attacks have audio/visual queues too) and is the single most important aspect of improving in the game - Staying calm, attacking aggressively but blocking/dodging the enemy when required.

Enemy variety is high and different enemies will use different tactics on you. That said, there are a few reused mini-boss enemies but those hardly matter when the highlight of the game are the bosses themselves. Every boss has different attacks/mechanics that require you to tackle them in different ways.

Tying together these amazing battles is a story which even has multiple endings as well! The world is a mix of linear and open world which in my opinion, is the best way to make a large game.

The only weak aspect of the game is the lack of fighting variety (no range or basic attack styles) in terms of perks (there are different power attacks but those are hardly usable on bosses).

The music is good and the audio feedback for attacks/blocks/dodges/deflections etc. are phenomenal!

Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice stands as one of the best games I have ever played, and beating the game was one of the most triumphant moments I've ever experienced.

The combat in this game is second to none, flawless, and I have yet to play a game with better combat aspects than Sekiro. The fights are very intense, demanding attention, reflexes, and most importantly dedication and patience. The learning curve may appear daunting initially, but the satisfaction when it finally clicks is immense. The game plays very fairly. When you die, it's not because of some cheap reason, you understand your fault, you learn and conquer. This game has exceptional boss fights, and they exist to challenge everything you've learned throughout the game. While some of them may seem unforgiving, you can overcome them, and you will! Delivering the final deathblow to an opponent is a feeling that never gets old. If you are still having a hard time with the game, then all you have to do is not give up. Also, remember not to hesitate in a battle.

Moreover, Sekiro excels in its captivating visuals, immersive atmosphere, and a musical score that beautifully complements the game's lively and captivating setting. All of these elements contribute to a deeply immersive experience. I wholeheartedly recommend Sekiro. Hope you enjoy the game as much as I did.",True

Its a mix of the souls style gameplay mixed in with an actual working stealth system similar to Assassins Creed. Even though stealth is used, the combat is what really hooked me in as it very intense and fluid, and while you fight similar enemies often, the fights never get stale. I also love the movement in this game as from what I've seen from the other souls games, you have so much more freedom in the movement from grappling rope to dodging and running. That's not including the excellent story telling that was crafted by the developers. It felt like watching an old samurai Chambara (Equal to Western/Cowboy movie).

,146668175,"Game was super difficult in the beginning- so much so that I almost quit completely. Coming from games like Dark Souls I was expecting a degree of difficulty but not of this magnitude. What am I doing wrong? I was dodging everything but I was still getting killed.

I come to find out that you need to DEFLECT attacks in Sekiro, that's the way it was meant to be played.

What's a deflect? Its like normal blocking but you don't hold the button down. You block at the VERY last second. Like right before the moment of impact. That's a deflect. It can be challenging too because different enemies have different attack patterns.

Get enough consecutive deflects and you can strike the opponent with a DEATHBLOW- watch as Sekiro mutilates your foe in a glorious display of blood and power! Very satisfying.

Once you get your bearings straight you will start to build a rhythm. You'll anticipate attacks before they happen. And DAMN does this keep you engaged!

I've never played a game like this before, I hope this deflecting concept catches on with future games. In a way it now resembles an actual sword fight.

I'm glad I stuck with it too because once you get past the initial threshold of the game being BALLS, you get to see some awesome castles!  From Software always has unparalleled graphics I absolutely love the landscapes they put in their games! The game becomes significantly easier once you get the deflecting down.

,88732554,"this game is undoubtedly my favorite game of all time. its not the best game, but its very close to perfect. the combat system is unique and exciting, and provides a fast paced battle that is consistently challenging and satisfying to overcome. people often complain about the lack of customization, and while there is significantly less than a dark souls game there is still a plethora of different ways to approach challenges. with the shinobi prosthetic having a significant amount of usage and different variants each with abilities to use against enemies. combat arts add another layer, creating more moves to master and more tactics to decide upon before battles. parrying reigns king, and its for the better. there are no attacks in the game in which you can not parry, save for those explicitly marked as unblockables. the game offers significant challenges in both the optional and mandatory content. along with this, there are ways to make the game even more challenging, which gives new life to the game after beating it a few times. the replay-ability is like no other game. you can practice for hours and hours, or days and weeks mastering every boss and its attacks, trying to beat the game as perfectly as you can. the story is somewhat lacking, but what is there is interesting and fabulous. the multiple endings are all worth going for as they all serve interesting endings to the story, and are all worth checking out. this is the first game i have ever sought out to 100% because of the enthralling combat and the ever-present feeling of victory. the imperfections lie when the game fails to play to its strengths; most sekiro encounters shine best as one on one duels, and there are many instances of gank-sessions that feel unfair and severely difficult, but it makes up for this slightly by making most of these types of fights easy to run away from or have some other method of crowd control to make it more fair. other than scripted sequences, the game offers little for crowd control. there are a few combat arts helpful for groups, and some prosthetic tools which also help, but largely it comes down it significant skill to deal with these fights. this game is worth the challenges, and worth doing everything, i highly recommend doing a 100% achievement run, and them some, as some minibosses, and other things are not required to get all of the achievements. 9/10 PLEASE MAKE A SEQUEL",True

,148981739,"[h3] An exploitative, nasty gambling front that you should stay away from at all costs [/h3]

Counter-Strike has been proliferated so deeply by gambling and predatory monetisation that, in its current form, the game is a hollow billboard advertisement for betting.

I’ve seen many of my closest friends become addicted to in-game betting through the likes of FIFA, now EA Sports FC. What initially starts as purchasing their favourite incarnation of Ronaldinho for Ultimate Team, becomes a business-like operation using third party gambling sites to become one of the few players to, on its surface, game the system. Many PC players would scoff at such blatantly exploitative practices, especially when its aimed at a casual console audience, yet what Counter-Strike 2 does is worse still.

Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) players are granted cases (lootboxes) for playing the game, which offer you the opportunity to spend money on a £2.15 key to open. These cases are dangled in front of you, making it appear that giving Valve money is a reward in and of itself. Opening these will literally show a visualised slot machine, which selects a pre-determined skin for you. These skins can be applied on your guns to show off to others, but even worse, can be traded on third-party betting sites which have been given Valve’s blessing.

In-game, CS2 is a hellish playground of flashy cosmetics paraded about like walking advertisements to promote this gambling. In fact, I would sooner find it easier to swallow brand advertisements from major tech companies used on player models than seeing the nauseating number of expensive skins increase any more. Furthermore, there’s no option to turn off other people’s skins from your perspective, meaning Valve would rather bait recovering gambling addicts further than let them play CS2 for fun.

CS2’s primary promotion tool was its new smoke physics. Well, I can’t think of anything more apt for a game designed to cover up such a remorseless vehicle for extracting money from impressionable people’s pockets under the guise of a multiplayer shooter. New, ultra bright lightening is used purely to make cosmetics as noticeable and enticing as possible.

That's the positive, now the negative... 
No Demolition and no Arms Race, which were two of the best things about CS:GO.
No heavy weapons - the sawn-off shotty and machine guns are all gone.
Less maps - plenty of long-term favourites have not been brought over to CS2 and the only maps you can select (or even load through the console) are the current rotation. No Assault, no Siege, no Aztec, no Dust, etc.
And, lastly, the bots are *dumb*, like really, really dumb. Not an issue if you never play against bots, obviously, but if you do then be prepared for opponents who are only marginally more challenging than the chickens.

In the following, I will explain to you why I gave a negative rating.
First, I would like to address the elephant in the room: The game is absolutely not finished! Releasing the game even though it has so many bugs and lacks so much content unlike CS:GO is just stupid of Valve. This just shows how much Valve cares about the community.... 
A much better plan would have been to release an open beta and really finish polishing the game, but Valve would rather release a broken and bad game.
Aside from the improved graphics, there's really nothing good to say about the game. The servers are bad and even crash sometimes. As a result, all players get 1k elo deducted, even though they didn't cancel the game. Steam support, when I asked them about it, said that they know about the problem but won't do anything. Furthermore, many maps and game modes, also as community servers and workshop maps that were available in CS:GO are not available at all. Don't even get me started on the astonishing amount of Bugs...
I have to say that I was already not a big fan of CS:GO but that Valve manages to publish even a worse game I would not have thought.

Old Review:

Dear Community and Valve,
In the following, I will explain to you why I gave a negative rating.
First of all you have to say that this game was a lot of fun and I invested many hours, but afterwards I am very sad to have played so many hours.
Valve doesn't care about the community at all and there is little or no new content. They just try to make money and don't pay attention to the community and the longtime players. . .
The ranking system should be completely reworked, because at the moment you can't play properly anymore, because every 2 players cheats or smurfs. Furthermore, there are hardly any capable or communicative players.And if these speak they are in 90% of the cases insults or speak something Russian (probabbly insults too), which absolutely does not contribute to the match. 
What you could really use are new maps. They also removed maps from the competitive and in normal game modes that many people would play, including me. (bring the old maps back especially the old Cobblestone)
If there are any questions after this review or if you still want to buy the game I can only wish that you find out for yourself and also write such a review. But im sure that u will have the same view as me, especially if you are new to the game and with a non premium account. But cheaters und smurfs are also playing with premium so that really doesn't matter...
Since Valve won't read this and doesn't take it seriously, it's more directed at the community.
Furthermore, you should not buy keys. I'm afraid I fell for that and lost a lot of money. Maybe Valve just got me addicted to gambling though that. But I have to admit that was also my stupidity
Also did I mentioned the VAC System... well its the Anti cheat software from valve but I actually think there is no anti cheat software because the cheaters I play against won't get banned...
I hope i could help you with my review but go check it out yourself since it is free to play now...",False

Only 8 maps at launch. No Cobblestone, no Cache, no Assault.

All the fun ""party modes"" were removed (Arms Race, Flying Scoutsman, demolition, and their associated maps). 

Dangerzone is gone. 

At the moment there's no CS2 community servers so if you wanted to play surf, you gotta download the csgo demo viewer to be able to do that. 

To remove CSGO and replace it with a version that's missing so much content is just...odd. Like..we'd have been fine waiting another 6 months-a year if it meant CS2 released with all the stuff that's currently missing.

Edit: And while this doesn't cause issues for me, the fact that there's no MacOS support is wack. I've seen countless mac users in the reviews that have hundreds to thousands of hours of playtime in CSGO. These people prolly bought CSGO before it went free, then also prolly spent a lot of money on skins and cases, and now they're just...not able to play. That's shitty as fuck, man.

December 2015: I played CS Beta to 1.6, never played source, CSGO is great however overall.

For vets there are some differences, rotation of maps is different, no iceworld, plus maps like Assault have been changed just enough that strategies in relation to them are different (gettting up and down ladders in the vents can be problematic).

Hackers exist on casual modes, though not on competitive.

Rating it at 7.5/10 at the moment, though have not played long enough IMO so rating might change though would not go up to 8/10, or lower than 7/10...

,143746100,"I'm very on the fence about this game. Once you get into it, it's really fun. It lends itself to fast-paced gameplay, zooming around tearing through enemies, which is incredibly satisfying. Improving feels rewarding, and earning your first few Boss Cells (rewards for completing a run which send you back the start to do it again, with increased difficulty) is really satisfying. The OST is also exceptional and the artstyle, though a somewhat mixed bag, really shines in a lot of the backgrounds for the different environments.

The problems - which to be honest are inherent to the game from the beginning - really start to show themselves once you hit 3/4BC as the game just becomes such a complete slog. 

There is definitely an element of mechanical skill to Dead Cells - you need to be able to react to enemies, obviously. But a large part of getting good at the game is purely knowledge. There are an absurd number of enemies, each with their own attack patterns and telegraphs. Becoming familiar with all of these is the biggest component of ""gitting gud"". Each biome has its own pool of enemies (some enemies show up in multiple places; others are exclusive to certain biomes), so learning a biome essentially constitutes learning how to read the enemies within it (and re-learning that pool each time new ones are added with new BCs).

Because the game never changes fundamentally between the Boss Cell levels, you're running the same biomes every time. You're therefore faced with a choice - you can just stick to the one route and minimise the amount of setbacks you'll face learning totally new enemies in addition to the BC difficulty increases (which really, is optimal, for reasons I'll get to), or you can mix it up for the sake of variety, but substantially increase the time you spend playing as you get used to dealing with new mobs. In the case of the latter, the variety is largely cancelled out by the frustration of losing what progress you'd made, since your existing mechanical skill only carries you so far against completely new enemies.

So you do the former. And this is what makes sense, as there is quite literally a best route in the game. Sewers->Prison->Sewers->Graveyard->Cavern straight up just gives you more scrolls. And you want scrolls, because the multiplicative scaling is really the best way by far to counter 5BC. Either you nuke everything, or you get nuked. And when one scroll is worth potentially hundreds of percentage more damage, of course you're going to take it.

All of this to say, grinding 5BC essentially just constitutes staring at Toxic Sewers for hours on end, especially if you're doing lots of runs to try achievements, or multiple routes/bosses. It ceases to be fun entirely.

Some other miscellaneous issues:
- The scroll system is poor. As soon as you start scaling, you're locked into a colour and two thirds of weapons become actively detrimental pickups.
- Weapons suffer the same issue as enemies. There are so many that you can either devote hundreds of hours to learning them, or turn on custom mode and engage with a handful you're comfortable with.
- The visual clutter is the worst I've ever seen. The accessibility update options mitigate this somewhat, but it's still not great. Pixel vomit everywhere.
- The game insists on having platforming sections despite the platforming being godawful. The jump feels sluggish and you snap to ledges to mantle them from miles away, removing pretty much any and all room for tight, skilful platforming. It's actually frustrating when you try to make a precise jump past something only to snap to it from halfway across the screen because the game is more interested in catering to people who have never played a platformer before.
- A lot of the ""difficulty"" comes from cheap enemies that wallhack you from off-screen and just very high volumes of very high-damage mobs that just get spammed more and more as the BCs go up, rather than any tests of mechanical skill, or game knowledge, which is part of what contributes to the sloggy feeling.
- The writing is painful. The game tries to have its cake and eat it too with le spooky mysterious vague lore a la Hollow Knight, but also le epic Rick and Morty taking nothing seriously jokes and banter, none of which is funny. One of the more poignant story beats (though that is a generous description) is undercut by the cringest line and le epic troll middle finger moment I've ever seen. It's like the Marvel ""so that just happened!"" on crack.
- The super secret ultra final twist boss is wildly underwhelming. One of the blandest, easiest final boss fights I've ever encountered. The rest of the bosses are also nothing to write home about. The game's combat shines better in biomes, at least before the grind wears you down.
- The devs milk this game to an obnoxious degree. Middling, half-hearted updates and DLCs years after launch, balance patches for a single player game - just move on lmao. All it serves to do is add bloat, which is bad for the player, because all these new weapons just take up space in your loot pool over the weapons you actually want to see, unless you're willing to sink potentially a thousand hours in learning every single weapon, but the combination of how insane an undertaking that'd be, and the existence of custom mode, makes me assume that isn't how the game is intended to be played.
- Also on the devs, they literally launched the game without an ending, and while the DLC that added it was free, the rest slotting into the main game despite being paywalled feels a little slimy.

Overall, Dead Cells is a game that seems to discourage you from engaging with it. It's designed in such a way that optimising for the smallest amount of content makes the game most bearable. And given how obnoxious it becomes anyway, maybe that's for the best. If you're content just playing this to 3BC, you'll probably have a blast, but as a full experience, I can't recommend it, especially for a comparatively high price tag (especially accounting for the DLC) as indie games go.

,145285469,"Title: A Rogue-like Masterpiece Unfolds - My Review of ""Dead Cells""

Steam's vast library of games has seen its fair share of rogue-likes, but among the myriad choices, there stands an undisputed champion – ""Dead Cells"". Developed by Motion Twin, this game transcends the boundaries of its genre, delivering an adrenaline-soaked experience that leaves players utterly captivated from their first electrifying encounter to the heart-pounding final showdown.

""Dead Cells"" is a visual spectacle that seamlessly blends pixel art aesthetics with modern design sensibilities. The meticulously crafted environments pulse with life, showcasing a diverse range of atmospheric settings that unfold in a symphony of colors. The game's attention to detail is nothing short of awe-inspiring – from the subtle play of light in dimly lit caverns to the frenetic explosions of vibrant energy during heated battles. Each frame is a work of art that engulfs players in a world as dangerous as it is mesmerizing.

The game's combat is a symphony of fluidity and precision. Every slash of your weapon, every dodge roll, and every well-timed parry carries a palpable weight that reinforces the player's connection to the protagonist. ""Dead Cells"" deftly combines strategic decision-making with lightning-fast reflexes, creating an intoxicating game-play loop that never grows stale. The intuitive controls become an extension of the player's will, allowing for endless creative approaches to each skirmish.

What sets ""Dead Cells"" apart from its contemporaries is its ingenious take on the rogue-like formula. Death is not an end, but a new beginning. The constantly shifting levels and enemy placements ensure that each foray into the unknown is a unique challenge. The game offers a wealth of weaponry and abilities that can be tailored to suit your preferred play-style, encouraging experimentation and evolution as you uncover devastating synergies. This creates an irresistible loop of progression and discovery, urging players to push their limits and delve deeper into the labyrinthine world.

The haunting melodies and atmospheric soundscapes of ""Dead Cells"" are an auditory delight. From the haunting echoes of desolate corridors to the pulse-pounding rhythms of intense battles, the music becomes an essential companion on this treacherous journey. It not only complements the visual splendor but also elevates the emotional resonance of each moment.

""Dead Cells"" presents its narrative with an intriguing subtlety that beckons players to piece together the story as they progress. The game leaves breadcrumbs of lore and tantalizing hints about the world's mysteries, encouraging a deeper engagement without imposing a rigid narrative structure. This enigmatic approach creates a sense of wonder and curiosity, making the discovery of hidden secrets all the more rewarding.

Ultimately, in the grand tapestry of video games, ""Dead Cells"" shines as a masterpiece that defies conventions. Its breathtaking visuals, exhilarating combat, and ingenious rogue-like design coalesce into an experience that is as addictive as it is unforgettable. With each run, you'll uncover a new layer of its brilliance, ensuring that ""Dead Cells"" remains an essential fixture in any gaming collection. Motion Twin has not just created a game; they have forged an enduring legend that will resonate for years to come.",True

The game is just all-around great and the amount of updates the devs have offered over the years proves that they still love this world they've made and value its fans. A lot has changed (usually for the better; ask the veteran players how Malaise used to work) but the standard gameplay has mostly remained the same because it was already strong from day one.

[i]Dead Cells[/i] can be tough, but in an accessible way. By the time you've successfully completed your first run and obtained the first (of perhaps many) Boss Cell, you will have amassed a vast inventory of tricks, tactics, weapons, abilities, and allies that got you that far and are more than capable of carrying you further.

,111860208,"I dare say this game is overrated.
- Difficulty is not determined as much by skill as much as it is by your enemies' numbers being bigger than yours. I'm not saying there's NO skill, but I'm also not saying the game will demand your skill any more than it will demand your patience.

- It was made at the stage of FromSoft's lifecycle where difficulty and dying a lot is the only thing that matters because Miyazaki gets $10 for every time a game journalist says ""[insert game here] Is the Dark Souls of [insert genre here]"", and it definitely shows.

- 90% of the game's bosses are fought the exact same way; They get close and rush you down while you roll around and maybe hit them once, twice if you're lucky before you go right back to Fred Durst'ing it until the boss's meter hits zero. Plus, the bosses who actually have unique gimmicks like Rykard and Radahn overstay their welcome long after you've figured them out. My favorite bosses in the game are Morgott and Hoarah Loux, but the fights themselves aren't cool, just the CONTEXT of them is cool (more on this later). I consider this to be a failure for the game; for its defining trait to be the least interesting part of itself.

- Despite the presence of a Souls-style leveling system, most enemies can kill you just by acknowledging your existence. And before some wise guy comes to this review and says ""bUt vIgOr"", it doesn't matter if your vigor is 17 or 70. There are enemies that will flatten you like a steamroller no matter how big your meter is, and the only time you will ever notice any difference with your stats against the area's enemies is when you come back to an area that hasn't been your problem for three weeks.
     “What if you were using the soreseals though? They’re good but maybe they were getting you killed”
     I never used the soreseals, since magic isn’t my primary source of damage. The closest thing I’ve had to a self-inflicted debuff was Fia’s blessing.

- The open world is a joke. All it fundamentally is is just Dark Souls with buffer zones that take a long time to cross. So basically you spend $60 on Dark Souls 3 with even more filler. There's nothing to do in the open world, and the closest thing there is to ""something to do"" is the mines and the catacombs which, if anyone has ever played Bloodborne, are fundamentally Chalice Dungeons, with no unique bosses, in dungeons that can't be randomized, with your reward being some Enemy Spirit Ash you'll never summon, or a trinket you could get in bulk anywhere else.
     On top of this, Torrent changes nothing. He only exists to justify having these buffer zones in the first place. Does he change the pace of the boss fights? Sometimes. Does he ever change the pace of UNIQUE or ESSENTIAL boss fights? No. There are too many places where this ""staple of Elden Ring"" can't be used, and there are even more places and events that could have been made better by his presence, such as during the final boss fight, which alone was terrible from a design standpoint because of how out-of-nowhere and chaotic it is. You can't even summon him during multiplayer, or while a Spirit Ash is active.

- To go over some story issues, we need to understand what makes storytelling work. ""Show, don't tell"" is the golden rule of storytelling. What happens in Elden Ring is that the most interesting parts of the lore are notes you read in some random article of gear, and 90% of it has nothing to do with how you play. For example, the name ""St. Trina"" has no relevance to you, the player, than to tell you what items are related to the Sleep ailment, but it shows up in the written lore as frequently as trees in a forest.
     Another example involves Mohg, a boss who has the power of ""Blood Fire"", bright-red flames that inflict the Bleed ailment. This is said to be done by ""lacerating the body of the Formless Mother"". This info is completely useless because it does not change how this magic works in any way. One may expect blood magic to be cast by using your HP as an alternative for MP, but it simply doesn't. It works like all other magic in the game. As someone who plays FANTASY RPGs to get invested in a FANTASY world, this mundane gameplay with outrageous lore reminds me of working retail, how there's this long eventful story of how a store you work in came to be, but the actual work you do asks nothing of you but your ability to listen, follow directions, and put up with the bullshit that comes with it.
     Dung Eater is supposed to be scary because people tell you he's scary. Rykard is supposed to be evil because people tell you he's evil. Marika is supposed to be great because people tell you she's great. Godrick is supposed to be a worthless failure because people tell you he's a worthless failure. There are way too few moments where the story or personality of a character is SHOWN, and not TOLD.
     To give an example of GOOD storytelling in a Souls game, look at Solaire from Dark Souls. He's a knight who governs a self-founded guild that believes brilliance is achieved by aiding others. This is expressed by Solaire's summon sign appearing the most frequently out of every NPC in the whole game. The only character to ever have this potential is Melina, and she doesn't even do it with the correct boss because of dumb plot reasons. Hoarah Loux? Radagon? Elden Beast? Nope. She shows up for ONE boss; Morgott, who's basically just there to guard a door he doesn't even have the key to. After that, the story writes itself in such a way that prevents her from ever doing this again, despite her only gimmick allegedly being LITERALLY FOLLOWING YOU EVERYWHERE.

- Compared to past games, multiplayer is even more pathetic here than it ever was before. To understand why, let's review some of the basic multiplayer rules established by past games. All Souls games before this one have had 'alive' and 'dead' states. Said states grant certain benefits and caveats. They also dictate what is possible in terms of multiplayer action.
     In Demon's Souls, players had to be in their dead form to enter other peoples' worlds, while players in their alive forms can be found by said dead-form players.
     This rule was much the same in Dark Souls, though it removed the hassle of having to be dead to cast a co-op sign.
In both games, being alive granted players host privileges as well as occasional HP buffs, depending on the game, but at the cost of unconditional vulnerability to invaders.
     In Elden Ring, for no reason at all, the two functions of the games' resurrection charms have been split up into separate items, which completely removes the stakes of granting yourself a substantial buff.

- Speaking of low-stakes multiplayer, invaders previously appeared in past games to play the role of the enemy, which is remarkable for a ROLE PLAYING GAME, for players to present as much a threat to each other as the rest of the game. However, in Elden Ring, these ""invaders"" need the host's permission to invade them.
     In regular gameplay, without an item called the Taunter's Tongue, it takes the presence of a friendly phantom to make invasion reception possible, which already stacks the odds against the invading party.
     Couple that with a competitive community that has no qualms with over-optimizing the fun out of the game, and you'd be lucky to invade a single world without getting annihilated in a nanosecond by solar flares, weapon pairs tuned to inflict Bleed nearly instantly, decay-inducing fog, and mega-lasers. That's no exaggeration.

There probably were or are good qualities of the game, but after having spent as much time on it as I have, and after beating the game MONTHS AHEAD OF MY FRIENDS WHO ACTUALLY LIKE IT, I am just sick of this game and everything to do with it. The base game has inspired too little faith in the DLC to ever consider coming back. If you STILL want to blast $60 on this game, all I can say is that you brought ALL of the ensuing frustration upon yourself.",False

The weapon upgrade system makes the build variety incredible because even the weapon you started the game with can carry you through the whole game. The issue with the system is that you need 12 of a single level of smithing stone but only 1 of a single level of somber stone making it much easier to just get a somber  weapon and be done with upgrading for most of the game. I love that the rolling feels so clean and that there are more attacks that you can jump over to dodge too. Another thing is that this is definitely the most accessible soulsborne game by far because of spirit summons, some of which can solo bosses for you. Along with that they kept co-op so you could also summon a friend, but they removed covenants which does make online much less fun. There is a lot of toxicity in the community from tryhards who want to tell you that you didnt beat the game unless you never used spirit summons or any weapon stronger than a piece of spaghetti, but they have no life so dont worry.

In several different moments of the game, I've been baffled by the unbalanced difficulty on certain spots of certain areas. It took me out of the immersion of the game when I had to just dash through all enemies without being able to explore the surrounding areas, or when I had to parkour to a place on the map where I could hit the enemy but the enemy could not hit me (including bosses). Farming and trying other builds did little difference.

Unlike other souls games, I did not feel like the questlines of most NPCs were rewarding. You'd receive items alright, but I felt like their story was lacking. And one of the only NPCs I really cared about got a terrible ending, despite me doing everything that they required of me to complete his questline. 

I understand that not all stories have to have a good ending but [SPOILERS] they didn't have to wreck master Hewg and Roderika like that. It felt like I've spent the whole game pursuing a power to change things to, possibly, the better, but all I achieved was a cutscene of my character sitting on a throne.

PROS:
• Amazing art direction, making graphic quality secondary. They've really poured the worldbuilding, and especially the legacy dungeons, with love and all they learned from previous games.
• Build diversity. Its basically Dark Souls II 2, with every sort of build imaginable being viable, adding on topic that more complexity of combat with the increased amount of spells, combos, powerstancing, guard counter and jump.
• Its cinema! Elden Ring bosses are the most cinematic experiences among every FromSoftware games, leaving you in awe with the sheer creativity of the developers.

CONS:
• Soulslike gameplay, and especially replayablity, does not go along with open world. Cryptic questlines at FromSoftware's fashion are hard to memorize in such big map and may require looking through a guide. And in further NG cycles, crossing the lands between over and over may become tiresome.
• Rushed development. The late game areas, much like any other FromSoftware titles, were rushed, not delivering a satisfying exploration, with lack of unique enemies to that areas, and frustrating enemy placement that may not make sense at all.
• Poor multiplayer experience. Probably the worst co-op and invasion system of FromSoftware games. Having horse disabled in co-op halts shared progression by a lot in a big map like the lands between. Invasion being tied exclusively to co-op worlds greatly discourages this unique PvP experience that has been a staple in previous titles. Furthermore, ashes of war being overtuned lead to repetitive and uninteresting multiplayer fights due to the overuse of them, despite Elden Ring combat having more depth than every other souls games.

,30211887,"Dear DOTA devs. Do you ever play YOUR OWN game? I guess not. Please tell me this:
How is it FAIR that you play a match, you get teamed with some idiots, and they can just report you for whatever reason like example ""You don't speak russian"". They are 3-4 friends and they decide to report you because they don't like you for not being russian. You reach a certain amount of reports against you and you are banned from all type of gameplay except Single Draw or whatever it's called. You can't even do some of the tutorial matches! So basically If i was to get together with 3 of my friends and just keep reporting everyone we play with we can just fuck them all over for laughs. How is this fair? I think you should work on your reporting system. 

Another point:
As a new player, 34 hours of gaming clocked by steam and 10+ hours of that was waiting for a match, like last night i waited 4 hours+ because i'm being put into low priority single draw matches for some asshats reporting me for not speaking russian. So as a new player WHY am i put against players with 1900 and 2400 hours+? How am i suppose to fight against them? You people REALLY need to get your head screwed on right.

Eventually my son asked to play a game that sounded to me like DOTA.  I been addicted ever since, and he's been playing since he was 6 years old.  The new patch I thought is a great way to freshen the game.  I hope they do radical changes like this every year to keep people into the game.   I see quite a few negative reviews.  Anyone who wants no change but is willing to play for 30 years can go back and play the WC3 with the mod, that thing is frozen in time forever.

,147833186,"Story is the highlight in this game, does a pretty good job at it. This is not a game to play if you enjoy difficult combat however. 

I struggled for the first 5 or so levels, but soon as I figured out how monsters attack, it was pretty easy. The main problem with combat is that there are 2 major ways to nullify damage. 

The Quen sign makes it so that you can be greedy with your attacks, going in for extra hits all the time that would otherwise prove fatal in other games. Then there is the sheer ridiculous amount of invulnerability frames that you can achieve. Geralt doesnt use stamina at all for dodging, and you can quickly shift between a light attack to a dodge and back into attack way too quickly.

So the combat gameplay loop is basically just spamming dodges, quen sign, and light attacks. There is never any needs to parry or roll, never any real need to use any of the other signs. I found myself able to take on enemies that were 2 times my level.",True

Every small detail of this game is spectacular, great characters that you will never forget, brilliantly well paced story with mind blowing twists, amazing music right at spot, even the side quests hit hard. The mini games like gwent, horse races, bare fistfights are so much fun. The whole Skellige region is a visual masterpiece, never seen such beautiful atmosphere in any other games. As always, your decisions matter, and they affect the storyline significantly. The Witcher 3 is leagues above its previous games. Don't waste your time deciding, buy the game and have the best experience of a Masterpiece such as this.

,58276780,"Imagine you're working in a 9-5 corporate job, you're done with your work, you come back home, log onto Steam, see your games list for 5 seconds, buy a game on sale that you're never going to play and then switch off your PC and go to a bar. While having a drink, you think of the good times when games used to be fun and authentic. But then you tell yourself, the problem isn't the games, its you. ""Its not that games aren't fun anymore, you have gotten older"".

And then I play Witcher 3. And suddenly I can't wait to get myself home after work. Do you have any idea how precious that feeling is ? The feeling that you are actually immersed in the protagonist' shoes. I find myself in anticipation and excitement for the new adventures that are waiting for me, I think while driving back home....""Where is this story headed ? What new places and characters I will meet ?"" And lets not talk about the characters. I thought myself as a guy who's dead on the inside and somehow these characters made me laugh, chuckle and empathise at the same time. I haven't felt these feelings for a game since 2008 when I played games such as Final Fantasy 12, Metal Gear Solid 3. Was I wrong to think that I was the problem and not the gaming industry that's shelling out mediocre AAA games with no memorable characters or storyline ?

And I got this game for 3$. 3$ !! And that includes the DLC ! I honestly feeling I looted these amazing devs. And I paid twice for games that are not even worth playing. 23 hours in and I still haven't scratched the surface of the story. The side quests are actually fun. I find myself doing the side quests more because its feels like I am watching another episode of the ""Witcher 3 TV show"". I love this open world, I actually take my time wandering around and exploring every nook and cranny. I haven't done this since GTA San Andreas. I look at some distant island or mountain that I find interesting and I decide to just walk there just for the fun of it. That's how beautiful this Open World this. This is Open World game done right.

This game truly is what set CDPR on the map for gaming due to its gorgeous graphics, and its amazing story telling. Finally, for me, a game that I can focus on the story primarily and not feel like i'm rushing this game. This is a game that delivers 80+ hours of STORY. 80 hours of the main quest and not including the side missions that you can get lost with. I love that the story missions are kept clean, meaning, I can take a break from the main story line and invest myself into a short but meaningful story line that doesn't feel like i'm starting a whole new plot. The DLC offers so much content, offers so much story, that they genuinely just fit with the main game. The stories intertwine with the main story at times and you forget that its extra content that didn't come with the base game.

Can't even be compared to the likes of RDR2 and Elden Ring. The fact that this is considered one of the greatest games of all time is a joke. I can totally see why people would like a game LIKE this, but NOT THIS. If you want a good fantasy RPG, then play skyrim, elden ring, dragons dogma, dark souls, kingdom come, diablo 2, the list goes on. Literally anything but this. Geralt's voice has to be the most cliche, annoying, atrocious piece of voice acting I've ever heard. I don't know what the devs were thinking when they released this train wreck and called it a game. My biggest issue, probably, is the sex. There is too. much. sex. It dominates the story, ruins the side quests, and is just unrealistic. Half the time it feels like the only point in the game is too see how many people you can smash in an hour. I'm not saying that games aren't allowed to feature nudity, but there's just so much of it. I don't mean to sound like I'm just another Karen, on just another rant, and play this game if you want, not my buisness, but MY advice? Dont play this game. It really is absolute bull.

Then theres the combat system, yikes. 

A weird amalgamation of animations and hitbox based fighting means that you have no control over your attacks. Want to do a quick attack? its not ur choice. geralt will decide to do a spin move into a slice if you are slightly too far from your opponent for the normal quick attack. the animation cant be canceled, and provides no i frames. Because it auto selects instead of allowing you to choose which attack you want to fucking use, you have no capability to counter attack an enemy attempting a distanced heavy attack whith a quicker lighter attack. In turn this makes the combat feel clunky, and winning boss fights more of a matter of luck than it is skill. It also means you are not rewarded for learning enemy move sets and attempting to predict their next attack. the game punishes you for being a gamer essentially.

I was the fps kid that was playing battlefield, call of duty, counter strike etc. I was always sceptical about the game about a grumpy white haired prick slaying monsters with a freaking silver sword. I couldn't be more wrong. At first the game was a hard dive for me as I never played games like this, but hour after hour I sank in the immersive world presented by CD Project Red. It felt especially close to my heart as I am a Polish and polish dubbing combined with the cultural references were incredible. The story was understandable even for a guy who never read the books or played any other game from this universe. It is for sure the best thing about this game. Main story is brilliant but the DLCs might even be better. The choices You need to make really matter, but nothing is black or white so it isn't really a choice between being a douchebag or a stereotypical brave and selfless hero. Adding to that some choices really allow You to choose how You feel about the situation. I loved the moments  when I was irritated at some character and I had the opportunity to tell them thing or two and show them who the boss is. About the gameplay, it is simple, not overly complicated and because of that it works perfectly. It's just a typical dogde/block and hit combat mixed with using witcher signs(casting fire, using magical shield etc),  but yet I always considered it satisfying and rewarding. Really I can't believe and accept the fact that I've finished the game, as it really became a part of me. The characters you come across are that realistically written you feel like they actually exist. The story is amazing and the gameplay is satisfying. The graphics are also stunning!

The continent of Temeria is a sprawling, living and breathing world filled with diverse landscapes, cities, villages, and wilderness. Every nook and cranny is meticulously detailed, creating a sense of immersion that few games can match.

2. A Riveting Story: At the heart of ""The Witcher 3"" lies a captivating narrative. You play as Geralt of Rivia, a grizzled monster hunter and skilled swordsman. The quest to find your missing adoptive daughter, Ciri, leads to a sprawling, emotionally charged tale filled with political intrigue, moral dilemmas, and unexpected twists. The choices you make have far-reaching consequences, ensuring a deeply personal and memorable experience.

3. Memorable Characters: The game is populated with a cast of unforgettable characters, each with their own distinct personalities and motivations. From the witty and sharp-tongued bard Dandelion to the enigmatic sorceress Yennefer, and the roguish bard and friend Zoltan, you'll form deep connections with these characters as you journey through their stories.

4. Engaging Combat: Combat in ""The Witcher 3"" is a finely tuned blend of swordplay, magic, and alchemy. Geralt's combat abilities allow for flexibility in tackling foes, and each encounter feels challenging and rewarding. Preparing for battles with the right potions, oils, and signs adds depth to the combat system.

5. Stunning Visuals and Sound: The game's graphics are a visual feast, with detailed character models, breathtaking landscapes, and realistic weather effects. The hauntingly beautiful soundtrack complements the fantasy world perfectly, enhancing the overall atmosphere.

6. Expansive Content: ""The Witcher 3"" is packed with content, including a main story that can take over 100 hours to complete, along with numerous side quests, monster hunts, and expansions that offer hours of additional gameplay. The ""Hearts of Stone"" and ""Blood and Wine"" expansions, in particular, are essentially full-fledged games in themselves.",True

Yes, but only at a deep discount. Maybe $15 tops. I have about 70 hours in, but don't load the game through Steam due to some mods.

I ran this on an R7 3700x with a 3070 and 32 GB of RAM. I game at 1080p with a wired PowerA and wired Xbox one controller. Running DX11 with no RT I was unable to get all settings to Ultra+. I have everything on Ultra but crowds on Ultra+. I was getting framerate crashes constantly, but oddly enough in areas that weren't very busy.  HBAO+ was unplayable on my system. Very poor optimization. 60 FPS at 1080 consistently on newer hardware was a struggle. Sadly, this is the new norm. Surprisingly, CP2077 runs much better on my system.

The good...

The story, the world, and the characters. CDPR is lucky to get great IP's for their games. They do an amazing job with them. There's so many great characters in the series. They're portrayed very well here. To modern game companies who struggle to write good female characters....here's a masterclass in how it's done. The world feels alive when it needs to. It's fully fleshed out. The writing on main and side quests is deeper than most games, and well fleshed out (this is what Ubi completely missed the mark on when copying this for the newer AC games.) There's also not nearly as many dropped button inputs common in most modern games. The world is beautiful, but that's not uncommon today. It's the new norm, and not very important to my experience (gameplay is far more important to me.) Gwent....nope...I didn't like Magic: The Gathering either, but it's good Gwent isn't forced on you to progress the story. Side content is also presented well in that you don't need to do it to progress the story (sadly another low standard in modern games.)


The ok...

The combat. I like it. It makes it feel live a vicious ballet. It has some problems with hit box detection (a common problem in every CDPR game.) The NG update made the signs far more usable. Ciri's story is a lot of fun, but could've been done better. You don't get access to any potions or items with her. You only get a new ability towards the end of her time. There should've been more progression on each part. This a game that requires a lot of time. Any main mission can easily last 60-90 minutes with minimal save points. I often have life going on around me, so I won't play any mission without at least an hour available. This may or may not affect you, so I put it in the middle. 


The bad...
It's an empty open world. It's not the worst thing, but traversing it feels bad. Roach sucks. His mechanics are about on a 2005 level of gameplay. Geralt's movement is also very clumsy. He goes from a crawl to a janky stutter in his movements. He gets caught on small objects constantly, He feels clumsy. It's another far out-dated mechanic I'd expect from a PS2 game. This combined with CDPR's poor hitbox detection can make it annoying to loot a crate. That leads into the loot. There's too much useless junk spread around a million crates in a room (the Witcher 1 had a better collection system than this.) The autoloot is essential because of this. The economy is about 25 to 1 on buying/selling prices (the first Witcher was about 5 to 1, and gamers are just used to grinding poor economies these days.) Fall damage can kill you easily considering it's so easy to fall/have your companion push off of something. The level of explaining the game is poor, which is also common these days (anyone who says older games didn't hold your hand is lying, as older games came with very detailed manuals explaining complex systems. This game's manual barely goes past explaining the HUD.) Nowadays devs would rather let Google sort it out then spend money making a manual. I'm not a fan of the way perks are used with the need for having load out slots, but that's me. Much like from the Witcher 1 to 2, my save didn't import this time either. Much like the Witcher 2, this game creates saves that can't be deleted. While I enjoyed the game enough, I didn't bother with the DLC, as the game just doesn't feel polished enough to make me care about continuing to play.

The game is fun, without a doubt. I recommend buying it. I just don't think it's a masterpiece. It's a mediocre game that can be enjoyed despite being made poorly. In a day where game stories are weak, and their worlds shallow, this game gets too many passes for it's low quality programming. It's a testament to modern shill media, and the effect on low standards in fans. I've played all the Witcher games, and CP 2077. The first Witcher was the best IMO because they used an existing engine, known for great games. They don't seem to understand game design without an existing winner of an engine.

I've enjoyed Elden Ring, Sekiro and Nioh massively but never played the DS series, so had high hopes for the widely acclaimed first game. Have to say it is a huge disappointment.

- I was prepared for clunky controls, but not something *this clunky*. Walking/running around is annoying slow. Input lags are even more severe than in Elden Ring. Rolling with the lightest armor felt like fat roll in ER. The combat was mediocre to start with and the controls just made it straight up painful.

- The game difficulty feels way too artificial and ultimately unfair. Git gud is only fun when you feel like you're moving toward achieving something. When you need to git gud just to avoid Crepe Demon's jump attack first thing you enter the door, you're just dealing with the game dev's malice and decide it's not worth it.

- Exploring the map was probably the only fun part but it is undermined by the lack of fast travel/means to avoid combat when moving between bonfires. I was trapped in the bonfire in upper blighttown for hours which basically ruined any excitement I had when I lit that bonfire. (ER/Sekiro have fast travel, for good reasons. Nioh doesn't have fast travel within a level but there's nijutsu that makes you invisible. Hollow knight has neither but running past enemies is way easier than in DS were you can barely run at all.)",False

Its just such a huge waste of your time, it's ridiculous. Not to mention boss fights, they're just boring.
Yes, it's supposed to be difficult and extremely challenging, and it delivers in that regard.
That being said, it's not what I personally consider a pleasurable gaming experience.

,146484201,"Well, isn't that a shame. If Elden Ring was a recommendation with an asterisk, then this has to be a recommendation with three asterisks at least. Really, it barely eeks out a positive review on the strength of its level design (the structures are a joy to explore in principle) and the fun I had performing the rather consistent parries.

Apart from that, I finally get that age-old ""artificial difficulty"" argument. Of course, that's always going to be an extremely silly term to call it and thus easy to dismiss, but it does address a mixture of jank and tedium which frequently mars enjoyment of Dark Souls. A lot of the bosses aren't hard per se - being slow, predictable and having a limited moveset, though the DLC is much better in that regard - but they do often take a stupid amount of hits, all the while you have to ensure you don't perish to jank: Questionable hit boxes on certain attacks, stage hazards, getting stuck on random bits on the ground, the camera...

Combine that with boss runs (again, never hard, just tedious) and you're looking at a lot of wasted time, plain and simple. It doesn't help that you're controlling a character that moves like a wet sponge and seems incapable of scaling anything higher than a stair. Your character arguably performs better when keeping what you might foolishly assume are the key tools of locking on (the one useful thing about the O&S fight is that it teaches you to stop doing that) and rolling (since you take additional damage during it) to a minimum. Hence why I say that exploring is fun [i]in principle[/i]. Which is stupid, because you have to, since you're also dealing with general FromSoft obscurity. The bottom line is that Dark Souls isn't hard because it's such a challenging test of skill, it's hard because it's a psychological test of how much repeated BS you're willing to tolerate.

So, feel free to make ample use of guides, because this is a very cool game to experience in many instances. Not that I think you have to experience it yourself; I'd say it's perfectly fine to just watch someone else play it and spare yourself the firsthand frustration. I think between the parries, some fun fights in non-boss sections, most bosses thankfully being easy enough to only take a few tries and the fantastic level structure, I had barely enough fun to make this thumb point upwards, but a glowing recommendation this is not.",True

Many have named the first game of the series as a masterpiece, and one of the greatest games ever made. Personally, I do not think that it actually is. But, it is a great game nonetheless, that reminded me of my early gaming days in the 90s.
The atmosphere is amazing, and the bleakness of the dying world slowly seeps into your soul. It is a difficult game but fair, despite some clunkiness. The majority of times that I died was either due to poor reaction times, or getting to greedy with my attacks and mismanaging my stamina. The only exception would be the Anor Londo Archers (yes, they deserve the capital letters). Lost almost 93000 souls to them and 12 humanity. 
Overall, I did not have much difficulty with the bosses. I beat Quelaag, Nito, Sif on my first try. Artorias, Manus, Kalameet and Ornstein and Smough on my third. And then we have the Capra Demon for 8 and the Bed of Chaos for 11... These two were a case of poor design. Especially in the case of the latter. In general, that part of the game seemed unfinished and it was a real slog. 
I certainly liked the challenge that the game presented me with. It was a long time since I had palpitations during a boss battle, and the exhilaration after I triumphed. This is the essence of Dark Souls. You get good. As simple as that. However, the quality of the game fluctuates especially in the second half.

The game is Brutal, but it's worth every minute of anger and grinding your teeth cause that dopamine hit is better than drugs.

The Story-telling although mostly through item descriptions and dialogue you have to do special requirements for, is truly a tale worth unpacking as their is a lot to be found within. And is a testament to how thought out the world your playing in is, which just adds to the experience.

The game is also janky in some regards, but in my opinion it adds to the charm. I love old games.

It has been pretty obvious that I'm not Chad enough for melee so I decided to start over and go easy mode, in other words, made a Sourcer. This decision allowed me to go though most of the side and the main content within 25 hours.

,146306319,"I realize I'm very late to this party and obviously got my money's worth on this game (judging by my play time), but I still came away from it with a bad taste in my mouth. I feel that, despite this game's good qualities, it still has a bunch of indisputably bad design decisions that I never hear anybody talk about, so I want to complain about them here.

I wrote an even longer review than this, but it ended up being too long for Steam. So instead of my usual list of pros and cons, I'll just list the bad design decisions that I feel people tend to overlook when extolling this game.

--- Bad design decisions featured in this game:

- As someone who mostly plays single-player games, this first point is one I am emphatically passionate about: if a game is presented as single-player, it should be playable without needing help or advice from other players (specifically, without needing to refer to a wiki). If the game doesn't give me the necessary tools to figure out everything for myself, if I need to read a wiki or find hints left by other players to learn basic information about a game, then that game is badly designed. Arbitrarily hiding information from players isn't making a game ""full of secrets"" or ""mysterious"", it's just making it obtuse and inaccessible. Without checking the wiki, there is no way for you to know:
        - How many souls a soul in your inventory is worth before using it (or until Frampt is available). This is especially true for boss souls (since the amount Frampt gives is not always the same as how much it's actually worth).
        - Which upgrade path for a weapon is best (you can only see how the weapon's stats change when upgrading to the next level, not the maximum number of levels nor the stats for each level). Additionally, once a weapon is upgraded, it's impossible to know whether a newly acquired weapon can be upgraded higher than the already-upgraded one or not. There is NO REASON this information couldn't have been made available in the game, and the game is not better or more fun for having this information withheld.
        - The necessary ingredients for boss weapons. The game won't even show which boss weapons can be crafted if you don't have the correct kinds of ingredient weapons in your inventory.
        - That equipment load affects run speed and roll speed. Also, there is no in-game way to know equipment load levels, which determine whether you do a fast/medium/slow roll. Considering how central combat and rolling are to this game, this is a major, inexcusable oversight.
        - What staggering is, and when/why some enemies stagger.
        - What being ""hollowed"" is, why this is relevant to the story, why the player character being hollowed is different from enemies being hollowed, or why enemies only attack you but not each other.
        - That being un-hollowed allows summoning help in boss fights. There is no other benefit to being un-hollowed (as it allows invasions), so it's easy to go through the entire game without realizing this.
        - That there are illusory walls (if you haven't discovered any by accident).
        - What invasions are, or when they are NPCs (which can be reasonably defeated by a sufficiently skilled player) or other human players (who have no visual indication of power level and may easily one-shot an unprepared player out of nowhere).
        - Which items are dropped by which enemies and how often. This is particularly important if certain weapon upgrades require rare materials, but there are not enough of them in chests around the world to fully upgrade a weapon (without going through the hassle of new game plus), so you need to grind certain enemies to get enough of them. There's no reason the game couldn't have had a codex that gets filled out with enemy information as you defeat them.
	
Besides hiding useful information from players for no reason, this game has plenty of other bad, stupid, and unjustifiable design choices:

- The game's entire move set is dumped on you in the very first level. If you don't master jumping and parrying, you may never be able to get back to this area to see the instructions.

- This game has no story, just unrelated events that happen in sequence. The ""story"" - if it can be called that - merely consists of the player character traveling to a series of different regions and killing boss monsters, usually without any information on who these monsters are, why they were important, nor whether the player character has any idea why they're doing this in the first place (aside from, ""Well, I'm playing a video game and I guess this is the way forward.""). This is where defenders of the game will give the weak counterargument that the story is in the flavor text of in-game items. To this I reply: reading item descriptions is a mediocre excuse for storytelling. Compare this to the storytelling in Subnautica or Skyrim: all information necessary to those stories is presented through dialogue and cut scenes, and most text is just for additional flavor and worldbuilding. And - most crucially - this information is presented in places where you'd actually think to look, like in-world books or highlighted entries in a codex, not fricken' item descriptions which are so often unhelpful, boring, or obtuse that you just learn to ignore them. Integrating storytelling with gameplay is the superior approach, and if Dark Souls had been well-made enough to do things this way, its fans wouldn't need to defend it. Extra points are deducted for weapons that have special effects which are only documented in flavor text.

- The fantasy elements in this game don't feel like they're from the same world. Sure, each different monster looks unique, but the bosses in particular feel like a grab-bag of fantasy elements, not parts of a consistent style or system.

- The world doesn't feel alive. All characters and enemies are just standing in place waiting for the player to come along and interact with them. Compare this to Skyrim, where NPCs have set routes and will walk from their house to work and back, or will even join you on quests to other locations. Additionally, the various towns you walk through in Dark Souls do not look like they were designed for actual people to live in (no beds, no bathrooms, no markets, unnatural layouts). This makes them feel very artificial and video-gamey.

- If you don't understand how ""builds"" work (that is, upgrading your stats to focus on damage vs. speed vs. magic), you can get yourself into a situation where you have to grind a lot to be reasonably leveled. Magic is particularly clunky to use in this game: you have to stand still in place for a second or two to cast any spell. Considering this leaves you wide open to backstabs and that enemy attacks can interrupt the spell, it doesn't seem balanced compared to combat. So in the early game if you spend several upgrade points on magic in the hopes it will get more powerful later, all that time and grinding will prove to be a waste, and will increase the cost of future upgrades for the stats that actually matter.

- There are places where you have to sit and wait for 30 seconds to be transported somewhere. In all other situations in this game, if something doesn't immediately happen when you take an action, this means you're missing a necessary item or have to complete some task elsewhere first. Having places in the game where you actually need to wait 30 boring seconds doing nothing is inconsistent and infuriating.

- The process for accessing the DLC (Oolacile and the Abyss) is unjustifiably obscure. It requires revisiting the least fun area in the whole game and killing a specific but otherwise nondescript enemy for no discernible reason. This isn't fun or challenging, it's just obtuse and inaccessible. (Plus, the process for downing Kalameet is similarly obscure and arbitrary.)",False

,137396132,"After playing through to the end of Dark Souls: Remastered, facing the 4 lords and learning the attack patterns of enemies I must say this is an excellent title. I like the lore, even though is can be very vague and the universe itself is shrouded in mystery, decay and hopelessness, but in the same vain there is still ""hope"" in the kindling of the first flame, there is beauty in the broken landscapes and dilapidated structures, Anor Londo was a big focal point of the game, at least when establishing the ""ruling hand"" of Lordran. When understanding the dynamic between the ruling class, what happened during the ancient Dragon wars involving the everlasting Dragons and the 4 Lords, as well as Gwyn, it makes you really feel just how bad things had become when you come in.

Gameplay in my opinion is SLOW, compared to even Dark Souls II SoTFs, and a snails pace compared to the likes of DSIII and Elden Ring. I won't say it's a bad thing, as it was much more challenging than Elden ring, the 4 Lords were easy enough even without help. The bed of chaos was, something? I feel that could've been done better. Gravelord Nito was difficult at first, but slow, and like much of the rest of the bosses, once you learn his attacks, and when to dodge, he becomes trivial. The four kings were more difficult, as at the time I'd say I was under-prepared in terms of DMG output, and as you continue to fight them off more ""clones"" appear. This was annoying to say the least, but he went down after a couple attempts. Lastly, Seath the scaleless was an okay fight, the curse infliction was a difficult obstacle, but once again, a couple attempts and a few thousand souls to level, he too went down.

The only negative things I can say about the game, is the collision of weapons in small corridors, on posts, objects etc. This has killed me many a times, but it is avoidable with proper kiting. 
I've mentioned it before, in my previous review. Invasions suck. It wouldn't need to be that way, If the latency wasn't such an issue. This seems to be an issue in DS 1-3 and I can't really see it any other way. Getting struck through blocks, getting struck when obviously out of range of an attack, it's not fun. Thankfully, you don't NEED to be human for any apparent buffs or bonuses, unlike in later titles. 

I think if you enjoy the fantasy genre, and want to challenge yourself as a gamer, give Dark souls a try. If you get mad take a break and come back later, I can certainly see why this game is held with such high regard.",True

I asked my son for help, and together we spent hours playing . I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died.

-Rich lore being amongst the most intriguing in the series.

Negatives:

-Adaptability is a concept that should've been explained a little better and refined more.
-Questionable hit detection if Adaptability isn't at 20 at least.
-Lifegems are a good idea but feel like a band-aid solution to lack of healing options
-The structure of the world can make it feel a little disjointed and confusing without a guide.

 There's a lot of bosses in Ds2 but i don't think that's a necessarily bad thing. I personally enjoyed fighting a boss after most areas. This is just my impression of the game after playing through it once.

It fixes many bugs and issues that are present in the original, but besides that, I can say with certainty this is likely one of the best games within the Soulsborne series. Just below Bloodborne but above Elden Ring for me. The base game os great, but the DLC is possibly the best in the entire series.

That doesn’t go for CotIK’s beginning area though. Hate those reindeers with a passion.

It's unpopular opinion, but for me this game is much better original Dark Souls ( as of time I haven't played DS1 remastered). Coming up with less memorable OST and less interesting world building, it comes strong with interesting and variety locations, a lot of bossess ( kind of con, since they are later mini-bossess) with some of them being interesting with a twist. Game is kind of harder, coming with new mechanics and DLC's that are bullshit. I haven't finished all bossfights in DS2, will come after them in SotfS. Some of areas are disgusting and stubborn to go through, some weapons suck, some questlines are tricky to do. But I am not gonna lie, I don't regret 100%-ing this game, despite some of hardcore grind nowadays, since multi is dead. Also this game will load for ~ 1 min bcs of trying to connecting - beware of that.

The net code, last I checked, was leagues better than the last game, and the work in so many aspects was such a jump in quality in only three years. The team really put their elbow grease into this, and it shows. 

The various gameplay changes-- such as the introduction of life gems, power stance, and two extra ring slots --were interesting and engaging, and while some were left behind, others made it into games that followed. Dark Souls 2 was daring and that was, more often than not, rewarded.

,117028098,"A game that has a legendary reputation in the Souls community and for good reason. It is seen as the worse Souls game in the entire franchise and I can't really fault anyone for saying that but I will defend that it is a good game at it's core still. The major problems this game faces are it's reliance on Humanoid/Armored boss fights compared to other games where it had a good ratio of monsters and humanoid, it's janky hit-boxes that will get you hit when you are not actively in a spot anymore (I have a theory on that), and it's rather bland map choices and inconsistencies. On the first point yeah there are way too many boss fights against dudes in armor. Even though most have different movesets it is not fun to fight them. The second is the hit box issues. When you dodge roll away or even the enemy does a wide swing and you aren't there you will get hit by their attacks sometimes. For me the worst offender here was the Smelter Demon whom you already have to fight in a tight ass room, you don't need this bullshit to make you second guess how well you are doing. The theory I have is two pronged. I think that the hit-boxes for some enemy weapons are more squared instead of being their weapons shape. So imagine a sword but it hit's like a rectangular plank in terms of size. Even if you dodge the point of the sword if you get hit by the invisible corner of the plank then it counts as a hit. The other issue is the new stat Adaptability which gives you more I frames when dodge rolling. In theory the game will give you more the more you put in and even though it says it does I think it derps out sometimes and reverts it to the base low dodge chance and will make you get hit when you should be in the middle of invincibility. I could be wrong on both fronts but that's the best I could think of after 7 runs on the PS3 and PC of this version of DS2. The final complaint is the maps and yeah I can't understand what they were thinking for some of these areas. Some are absolutely some of the coolest in the series and others are the absolute worst. One in particular has my ire and that would be the Black Gulch. Its essentially a long straight area with a few places to explore on the sides. It is surrounded by statues that spit poison at you that stun lock you sometimes if you get hit, oil on the ground that houses trap enemies, worms that come out of the walls that smack you off the sides to your death, and a Boss that is so boring I would skip every time if I could. Now that I've shit on this game for a while let's talk about some of the positives for a bit. It introduces a mechanic that makes it my favorite Souls game to try builds with, the ability to RESPEC! I don't know why for the life of me From refused to put this in the other games but this is an absolute game changer. For one playthrough I would play a mage, another my best Guts cosplay, and another a holy cleric out to smite the heathens of the land (before the heavy lightning nerfs hit anyway). Definitely adds to the replayability. It also has some of the coolest fights I've seen in a while with the Mirror Knight bringing back a mechanic from Demon's Souls. The combat is livened up a bit with the ability to dual wield certain weapons together to create new combos to overwhelm enemies easier. The story and characters are relatively weak as far as these games go but I did like Lucatiel and the Maiden. For all the shit this game gets (rightfully so in some areas) as a Souls fan I would still say it is worth playing. Now as you have the option of picking this or the SOTFS edition that version made things a lot better by adding new balancing and enemy placement but I would almost say play both if you can just to see the changes yourself. For this version though as it stands today I wouldn't recommend for more than $30 for the complete package. Also a note, From has shut down the servers to this game ""temporarily"" but that's looking like we might not see them come back, making some of the achievements damn near impossible to get because of poor item drop rates. If you are a hunter please be aware of this.",True

Patience and planning is mandatory, without it it's just pure frustration. Not as hard as I thought it would be (Scholar of The First Sin didn't do it any favours). It has more to offer than DS1, but it's executed worse. Also the graphics feel downgraded and upgreded at the same time compared to the first enstallement, which I find odd but fascinating. The art style is... unique I say. Enemy design is good. Boss design is acceptable, with a few golden examples and quite a lot truly AWFUL encounters, that make you question how fair the game was made. The main problem is often too many enemies.
Story is good, better than in the DS1 i'd say. Some new mechanics are truly creative and some just... Makes you want not to play this game.
Overall, it's 75/100, which makes it the second worst out of the Souls Series, a few levels above Scholar of The First Sin edition. Buy the base version with DLC than that pile of garbage.

,29681944,"[h1] The Elden Ring Beta [/h1] 
Dark Souls II has a bad reputation in the souls community despite it being highly praised upon release. This still persists today although is slowly diminishing. It suffers from what most sequels do; having to live up to expectations. It has to be challenging, it has to have more of everything; Lore, Bosses, Weapons, Armour, Quests, Areas, NPCs, Magic!

DS2 is in a sense a beta version of Elden Ring but it failed to meet the lofty expectations because of poor leadership; and too big a scope for the technology and experience they had at the time.

Despite all this it's most certainly worth the money and the time; it's a great game that experiments with the Dark Souls formula and succeeds in many areas just as much as it fails. 

The only thing that disappoints me about it is knowing what could have been had they been more experienced at the time and didn't squander so many years of development.

Actually even more disappointing than that is the fact that in Dark Souls 3 FromSoftware seemed to be scared to break the mould again and not only retcons the vast majority of the story and lore of DS2 but constantly leverages cheap call-backs to DS1 instead of being creative and giving us entirely fresh stories and locations free of the shackles of the previous titles; Something they are very capable of as shown by other works: Bloodborne and later Sekiro.",True

Play around with the stats, learn the strengths and weakness from each boss, choose multiple weapons - only one single option is not enough for all the encounters.

,35227863,"Dark Souls 2, offers a world inspired by mortality, ancient gear, the occult, medieval architecture, and danger. The world does not offer guidence, and relies on persistence to overcome uncertainties.
The characters are off-putting. They have grim, personal, and convoluted background stories.

During play, explore the world, revisit locations, uncover gear, and become more powerful through combat. Slaying adversaries will strengthen a protagonist, and slain adversaries will reappear eventually.
To win, journey through a maze of different areas, and to the final chamber. This path becomes increasingly more difficult to get through.

It is possible to empower and modify a protagonist, and battles push back a protagonist's progress when it is killed.
Both enemies and allies may be encountered.

This game is a masterpiece, and everyone knows that. So, let me just share my personal [i]Dark Swols[/i] experience. For those unfamiliar, it involves doing 10 push-ups, pull-ups, or any exercise reps each time you die in the game. After stumbling upon a Steam review about it, I decided it would be cool to give it a shot. After all, I did git gud through my experiences with Dark Souls 1, 2, and Elden Ring, so I wasn't dying frequently in this game. Surely, it wouldn't be that hard... I couldn't have been more mistaken. It turned out to be a grave miscalculation, as the game grew progressively more challenging, pushing me to my limits, especially during certain boss fights. I became excessively cautious and significantly extended the game's duration for me, much more than I should have. But in the end, I finally did it, and my god, it was such a journey.

I recommend taking on this challenge for a more suffering-inducing adventure. If mental strain alone isn't sufficient for you, add a physical dimension to it as well. [i]Git gud or git ripped, casul![/i]",True

The bleak atmosphere contrasts perfectly with the feeling of achievement when beating a difficult section of the game.

Playing together with other players can be a lot of fun and the PvP is very rewarding.,True
,146455249,"If the first Dark Souls depicted a world gracefully drifting towards the apocalypse, Dark Souls 3 shows one on a spiraling, feverish descent directly into it. It’s a fierce and punishing behemoth that dares you to take a step forward before knocking you back, again and again and again. But with a bleak, yet beautiful world that’s enthralling to explore and packed with secrets to find, I always felt compelled to come back, eager for that familiar thrill of overcoming even the most exacting challenges.

Dark Souls 3 does suffer from occasional framerate dips and a few underwhelming boss fights, but beyond that, its epic scale, aggressive obstacles, and rich development of existing lore make it the grandest and fiercest Dark Souls adventure yet.

The Kingdom of Lothric and the lands that lie beyond contain some of the most visually striking places developer From Software has ever crafted. Even though many of its locations do recycle ideas from familiar locales (like the Catacombs and yet another poison swamp), they're distinguished well enough to feel distinct from their past game parallels. There was never a moment when I didn’t feel captivated by their strong sense of place and the amount of gorgeous detail put into each environment. I stared out in awe atop the crumbling medieval stronghold of the High Wall, taking in the view of its surrounding valleys and snow-capped mountains, while all around me the fort’s frenzied denizens turned to stone and wood mid-prayer. I trudged through the poison swamps of the Road of Sacrifices while battling seething, cross-bearing beasts, braved Irithyll’s chilling, Tower of Latria-like dungeon, and got lost in a multi-story maze of curse-ridden bookshelves in the Grand Archives.

Every level is not only full of breathtaking architectural marvels and the most minute environmental embellishments, but also dense with things to do and see from moment to moment. But those views are more intense than Dark Souls 3 can handle – dramatic framerate dips (which we saw even on an ultra-high-end PC with two GeForce GTX Titan Zs) caused a lot of these fantastic looking areas to drag along, sometimes down to 20 to 25 FPS. But the rest of the time, when it is running at a smooth 60 (on PC only), Dark Souls 3 is a sight to see.

Exploration of the aforementioned places is the cornerstone of this series, and Dark Souls 3’s world does a lot to reward an inquisitive and thorough nature. You could spend hours in a single area, diligently investigating every dark corner or side road, and be consistently rewarded with some interesting story revelation, new gear, mini bosses, and even entire secret areas. Illusory walls make a triumphant return, driving me to compulsively slash away at suspicious-looking dents or bricks in search of precious equipment. I got a pretty high rate of return on doing that, too, from the earliest levels to the very late game. Crystal lizards also must have had a breeding season, because there are a ton of them slithering around, ripe for the slaying and with lots of twinkling titanite for leveling up special weapons.

Dark Souls 3’s world isn’t as openly interconnected as that of Dark Souls 1 (where you can freely move between high and low-level areas), but individual areas still weave their own branching paths together seamlessly, creating twisting mazes of overlapping passages and shortcuts that were a joy to lose myself in. Perhaps it’s because of this lack of interconnectivity that Dark Souls 3 feels larger than the first game. Early and late-game levels don’t directly connect as often, so the more you progress linearly from level to level, the farther it seems like you’ve journeyed.
Your progress is marked by massive landmarks, which lend the world a cohesive quality. In several early levels, I could maintain sight of the High Wall from which I’d originally come; while trying to extinguish a series of beacons as part of the entry process for a boss, I scaled a huge ladder through the thick canopy of trees blocking my view and could see clearly where I was in relation to the first level. I recalled seeing nearly this exact place too, from another spot on the High Wall.

This solid sense of space and geography elevates Dark Souls 3’s level design beyond the relatively weak blueprint of Dark Souls 2, making a mostly triumphant return to the kind of large-scale, world-focused journey of Dark Souls 1. Perhaps the only things sadly missing from Dark Souls 3’s environments are the kind of interesting platforming challenges present in places like Dark Souls 1’s Sen’s Fortress or Crystal Cave.

Kindling Friendships
There are plenty of interesting characters to meet throughout Dark Souls 3, some new and some returning. The voice acting is great as always and characters have a ton of dialogue to exhaust, offering up plenty of new emotes to perform, dropping useful hints about the world and your role in it, and generally cementing themselves as the next in a line of odd, yet lovable Souls personalities. Like in past games, NPC questlines remain mysteries to be solved over the long term of your adventure, so in my first 35-hour playthrough they weren’t all completed. I let a couple characters die because of my failure to encounter them in certain areas or meet certain circumstances, but in keeping with true Dark Souls fashion, even death has its rewards: those conclusions still had something interesting to offer in the way of tragic closure, sometimes tied to other plot details in startling ways, or neat new items. 

I look forward to following these questlines more closely in future playthroughs, but I worry that a few bugs I ran into in my first one might impede that. Early on, one particularly sneaky character appeared to ask me for forgiveness for a past misdeed, but it was my first time meeting him in Dark Souls 3. I later found out that he was supposed to show up at a certain spot much earlier, but he must’ve missed his cue. Another character who showed up after I’d spoken to a covenant leader swore the two of us were enemies from then on, even though I had never met her prior to that. I wasn’t even part of the covenant – even though joining any one of Dark Souls 3’s eight covenants is now as convenient as snapping a badge in place in your inventory, I hadn’t done that here. But I suppose for this disgruntled NPC, just talking to the leader is good enough.

The Art of the Kill
The brutality of Dark Souls 3’s worlds and the beasts that roam there are matched only by its vicious new moves called weapon arts, which add variety and style to an already strong combat system: one moment I’m crushing enemies with the devastating weight of my greatsword, the next I’m turning the giant hunk of curved steel into a graceful propeller of destruction.

Executing these skills use up focus points (FP), the newly added blue bar below your HP and above your stamina that also acts as mana for casting spells and pyromancies. When your FP runs out, some weapon arts, like the aforementioned greatsword propeller (Exiled Greatsword – seriously, use it), start costing stamina instead – a sensible and acceptable trade-off. Certain other skills, like a lightning spear that lets you charge at enemies with an electrifying blast, let you complete the move without the elemental damage until you recover FP, so running out of FP isn’t necessarily urgent or mood-killing. It becomes far more important when you’re a spellcaster, because the amount of spell charges you have depends on FP, but the system is actually more generous than it is limiting. That’s because of a new reusable item called Ashen Estus.",True

Dark souls is a major thing for me as it helps you understand the perseverance will eventually get you to where you wanna go, the dark souls series will always hold a special place in my heart and the first one will forever be my favorite game of all time. As the first Dark souls was the game that essentially ""kindled"" my love for gaming because at that time it was waning I remember defeating Gwyn for the first time it felt so good but left emptiness in my heart the joy and the excitement the first time I felt it was amazing I wanted to play more souls games. As I did I played the whole DS1 with dlcs and everything completed it all loved it will forever be my favorite souls game, after that I played DS2 which was not really up to my standards as it didn't feel like a souls game when I finished it I didn't bother playing the dlc even knowing there was a formidable opponent that is Fume knight Ds2 just didn't feel right although despite it being the black horse of the souls series I still enjoyed it quite a bit. Then came DS3 I was waiting for this fucking game to sale and when I finally got it I just fucking played it non stop and when they played lord of cinder in phase 2 it really got me like holy shit it felt like it took me back to DS1 and a huge thumbs up to DS3, my ranking is as follows; DS1, DS3, DS2.

Does it have the weapon diversity of DS2: Yes but closer to the ""this is an [x] but different"" feel of DS1

This game is overhyped as hell.
As the [i][b]FINAL DARK SOULS GAME[/b][/i], it doesn't feel like it's very final. For a franchise that prides itself on difficult boss battles, and for just being difficult generally, I didn't find it all that hard (save select bosses [i] from the DLC[/i] and base game).
I don't think its difficulty being relatively easier than the other FromSoft titles I've played wouldn't be as much of an issue if it weren't [b][i]THE FINAL DARK SOULS GAME[/i][/b], yet I still had a decently fun time with it.
This is a recommendation with a citation that [i]the base game[/i] isn't that difficult, but the DLC elevates it slightly higher due to its bosses.
Don't make the same mistake I did thinking this would be a grandiose, balls-to-the-walls finale in the base game; play the DLC, and it gets brought up from a C to a B+ (if I had to give it a letter grade).",True

,138174457,"After getting all achievements for this game, I can confidently say this game is one of the best in the franchise.

The only slight issue I have is that the map layout was nowhere near as interconnected as the likes of DS1, but this game makes up for it with the quality of bosses and NPCs. I will give this game an 8.5/10

Here are my personal strengths and weaknesses for this game.

Pros:
- Great boss fights, some of my favourite bosses of all time are from this game.
- Very memorable NPCs and characters with fun side quests
- Very good progression system which isn't too confusing and isn't too basic
- Areas are visually amazing. as well as an amazing soundtrack

- Linear map design, not as intricate as previous titles but there's still elements of exploration",True

,67961599,"The dark souls games are not as good as the reviews they generally get. They are not as much hard as they are a game of memorization. Once you know where the enemies are and what their attack patterns are, it is relatively easy. Until then, you will die over and over in cheap ways because the game is intentionally designed to be annoying on your fist play-though.

There have been so few changes to the core mechanics of the game since the original Dark Souls. It almost feels like a DLC for the original game that just added more content. There are so many game mechanics that could improve these games so they are not a chore to play through the first time, but multiple games in and they have yet to change anything, and fans of the franchise are so stubborn that they refuse to admit the franchise's shortcomings. Here are just a few ideas that would make the Dark Souls games infinitely better:
[list]
    [*]Speed up the process of restarting. Don't make me wait for slow animations like standing up from a bonfire. reduce the size of the maps so there is less walking. Make the menus quicker. Add an option to immediately respawn when you die rather than having to wait multiple seconds while it slowly shows ""you died."" It just all needs to be sped up a lot.
    [*]Add friendly fire for enemy attacks. then we could learn attack & hitbox timing while playing it safe and manipulating enemy positions
    [*]Add a time rewind mechanics (like Prince of Persia)
    [*]Add a ghost mode trigger-able from fire pits that lets you explore ahead to analyze the map without interacting with anything, and upon leaving ghost mode you would return to the fire pit you triggered it from
    [*]Add a meditation mode trigger-able from fire pits that lets you train against enemies so you can learn their attacks before facing them for real
    [*]Add a spell in the beginning of the game that reveals (wall hacks) all enemies for a period of time
    [*]Add a Libra spell obtainable in the beginning of the game (see Final Fantasy if unfamiliar with ""Libra"")
    [*]Add a ghost clone spell (similar to the clone ability in Halo Reach) that creates a ghost  clone of your character that runs forward and agro enemies so you can see the enemies and prepare
    [*]Add teleportation spells (similar to ""mark"" and ""recall"" in Elder Scrolls: Morrowind) that let you warp backwards to re-assess your situation if you are surprised by a new enemy
    [*]Add an icon that shows how many enemies are currently agro-ed to you (similar to most stealth games such as Shadow Of Mordor)
    [*]Add a spell, character upgrade, or game setting that adds a mini map that highlights enemy locations/directions
    [*]Add a way to find bonfires so you don't accidentally skip them
    [*]Add an item that will automatically trigger a dodge or perfect block before you would take damage but prevents you from attacking. This way you can learn the timing of the enemy hits and then unequipped the item when you are ready to go on the offensive.
    [*]Add circles around enemies to show their agro ranges
[/list]
Any/all of these mechanics would make the game less about memorization, and it would make death more justified as you would have an actual chance to avoid it your first play-though.

The physics have always sucked in every dark souls game. Several of your deaths are bound to be due to the piss poor physics such as not being able to run over a 0.5ft obstacle on the ground. The real enemy in these games is the god damn furniture.

The game also has numerous technical issues. The game has really bad screen tearing that require you to go into Nvidia Control Panel and force VSYNC to be enabled. The sound effects also often glitch out when multiple sound effects play at once. The game is also locked at 60 FPS and while it doesn't have very much slowdown, it shouldn't be locked to 60 FPS in the first place. This is a AAA game; it should have an unlocked framerate. There are mods out there to unlock it, so why have they not done so to the official release?

One of the biggest complaints I have though is that the game does not support cloud saves. If you uninstall the game or move the installation you can lose your entire save data. You cannot play the same character on both your Steam Deck and your PC because there are no cloud saves.",False

11/10, I would highly recommend this game to anybody considering getting it.",True
,147955397,"Well, as you saw, my LOVE of HK is just show on my playtime.
My best friend introduced me the HK and when I saw his playtime is 99 hours, then I know it must be a legendry game……I trusted him so much that I forgot there was another possibility is that, the game may be too difficult to pass. Well, I just found it out when I was exploring the Crossroads. Like too expensive to buy crucial map tools, too easy to die, and had LITTLE guide. I can hardly remember how I get through these difficulties at first, all painful memory like being killed by the Groze Mother and False Knight and Hornet, again and again, and spending hours and hours in exploring the map and dying and back to the bench and setting off again. 
I had asked myself that, so hard and so much death the game brought me, then why I never give up and lay on the bench forever? It mustn’t be I have a knack on setbacks.
Then I came to realized that there is love, my love for HK grows more and more as I traveled farther and farther from the Crossroad. I love the raindrops in the City of Tears, the sparkle crystal on the Peak. I love adventure in the bugs’ world, greenly and lively the Greenpath, snowy and windy forever at the Kingdom’s Edge, bubbles and dreamlike fog flow in the Canyon. And surely I can’t forget to love those soft and cute fungus and grace mantis and furry bees in the Hive. When the unique BGM of every area flows, 
There is still something more than love. MOVED. Quirrel, Hornet, Myla, Cloth, Cornifer, Grimm and the shop keepers. They are just alive, and help me a freshman in the Hollownest. I still remember the first NPC I met, the Elderbug, I talked with him and he told me to sit on the bench, be a company with him. When I was tired of risk in the underground, I’d like to sit there for a while. It feels that the bench in Dirtmouth is another homestay. I can’t forget the beautiful voice from Myla either, I like her song most in the Hollownest world. She has a really simple dream but it just can’t survive in the Hollownest. Quirrel and Cloth showed up in the fights that I had thought as a tough one to one, the Hornet face the fate of Vessel with me together. The little knight is lonely but also not lonely, at least at those moments.
The mission of Vessel is tough. The fade of the Kingdom is unchangeable. Most thing I saw here is tragedy. But exploring story and secrets in the world, and fighting and taking adventures through areas has a special charm for me. I felt sorry for the fate of the world, while also being moved and love the game.
There are still too much I haven’t mention. If you see this long passage and decide to enter the HK world, it would be the best and you won’t regret.",True

,147912967,"A disappointing game. 

The good:
 - Has ability to map movement to WASD and can click a button to use weapon

The bad:
 - No way to use the mouse
 - Keybinds are confusing
 - Terrible Dialogue
 - Very bad explanations about how to get started. I.e. until you get the map sorted out the game is impossible
 - You die too fast. No easy way to drop difficulty level. Even for seasoned players
 - Could use better visuals, Some vocals and better sound effects. 
 - Jumping mechanics pale in comparison to Ori, Free Cell, Celeste and the like. Here you just fall of ledges if you're off the hitbox even if the graphic makes it look like you should have stuck. 

Other thoughts:
 - Game clearly made for controllers and absolutely sucks when using keyboard. Why on Earth would you need to hold a key longer to jump higher?!?? Press the button again, like every other game does. Unintuitive controls like forces really long learning curve. But since the game isn't fun, I don't see why anyone would do that.",False

I didn't think it would be, that it'd be impossible to read the content on the deck, but it is legible and I'm glad to be able to play this when I'm on the road on it, or on my PC at home.

2 thumbs up and 5 stars if you're looking for a traditional turn-based RPG.  Even better if you can snag it on a sale!",True
,145944364,"For a game that wants to force you into combat at every opportunity...the combat is terrible.  I swear it was designed around the assumption that the player would save-scum before every single encounter and grind it until they got the favorable outcome.  And for a system where 0HP equals instant death the inability to resurrect outside of combat without a scroll is a terrible design decision, especially in early-game where you don't have access to such things.  Why bother even having combat if your encounter design just kills the player by pitting them against multiple enemies with AoE DOT attacks.  I honestly don't know what game everybody else is praising, because this is one of the worst RPG experiences I've ever had.  I've beaten a number of old-school RPGs, including some TSR games and Fallout 1+2, and none of them felt like they were out to destroy your fun like this game was.",False

Quality of the game drops noticeably with each following chapter. 
Characters and the surrounding world are bland and the all consuming potential end of the world threat  barely effects anything that happens in the world- despite being all anyone talks about in the game, that or the most recent(and apparently the only) event in history, some 30 years ago. 
The writing is weak. 
Combat might be even worse as it boils down to breaking the enemy respective armor type and then combo/stunlocking them to death - meaning theres no or very little reason to have either magical AND physical attacks in your party, pick one and stick too it.

,145931799,"And so, the final game in the saga of Rivellon's fate has concluded. Overall, I must say I enjoyed the game. Among its strengths, I can highlight the non-linearity of the plot, a vast array of quests, an extensively developed magical skill system (the most developed in the series), beautiful graphics, atmosphere, and pleasant music (though it must be acknowledged that Kirill Pokrovsky is irreplaceable).

Despite the many merits of the game, there is one important aspect that somewhat dimmed the joy of playing ""Original Sin 2."" I'm referring not to the color palette (brighter than in previous games) or the turn-based combat system, which some may have reservations about. Unexpectedly for me, Larian Studios disappointed in the narrative department. While playing the latest installment in the series, I couldn't shake the feeling that it was loosely connected to the previous entries, particularly ""Original Sin 1."" The creators of the game chose to radically alter our perception of the divine from Divine Divinity. Lucian (the divine figure in this game) is portrayed as an extremely contradictory character who used weapons of mass destruction against his enemies and practically wiped out the elves in the process. As the story unfolds, we are told about many other killings committed by the divine figure in pursuit of his goals. It's worth noting that in the other games of the series, there was no hint of anything similar, including in the latest game, Divinity II: Ego Draconis, where the divine figure was portrayed as heroic and unequivocally positive.

Another narrative peculiarity was the storyline involving the gods. Here too, the creators wanted to surprise us: it turns out that the gods, who once created the ancient races and the mages, are not gods but former rulers (local leaders) who seized magical energy (the source). The created races are only useful to them for obtaining energy. Such an approach somewhat diminishes the enjoyment of the gameplay, as this is a fantasy game, not a scientific lecture, and such details seem out of place. It feels like in the sixth installment, the employees of Larian Studios wanted to share their personal views on religion, leading to a significant change in the mythology of the Rivellon universe. From my perspective, it turned out to be highly inconsistent and unsuccessful: in other parts of the series, there was a sense that we were living in a great era and undertaking grandiose actions to do something good. In ""Original Sin 2,"" we have a rather peculiar divine figure (from the first part), the absence of real gods, and very strong inconsistencies with other parts of the game.

Perhaps the studio simply grew tired of the Rivellon universe and ran out of ideas. Well, in any case, thank you for the amazing journey through Rivellon and Nemesis, and good luck with your future projects!",True

,145758526,"Bought this years ago.  Went back and picked this back up after having lots of fun with BG3 since I knew much of what went into BG3 was derived from Div2.

Couldn't have been more disappointed.

For some reason I remember the game being less tedious.  There's not the same conveyance of where enemies are or what things will do.  Good example are the ""Formations"" which will see your party go lurching off in some random direction at the start of combat or cram neatly into a corner for the enemies to AOE bomb you because apparently you approached combat and your lead was facing 15 degrees to the left?  No idea what causes it to happen, but the fact that having the lead even a mediocre distance ahead can leave my rear companion literally out of initiative makes me wonder wtf they were thinking.

The story is paper-thin and so are the companions.  The depth is all in the combat system and the various builds you can make, but the game all but hard punishes you for playing any kind of ""pure"" class, since even the smallest bit of dabbling can get you teleports, haste, invis, etc.  There's way less emphasis on playing a ""Role"" in this RPG and instead just kitting out whatever build will break the game the hardest and mow through combat.

It's clear the shortcomings with BG3's inventory were products of Div2, because lord all the same issues are present.  Additionally while definitely an unfair comparison to modern games, it's hard to not feel like everything in this game is made of play-dough with how the visuals look.

Tl;dr:  Between the vague story, barely-there ""companions"", an overly-gamified combat system that begs you to break it, and all the other shortcomings Larian left behind when they started work on BG3, it's really not worth your time.  Just play BG3 - it's a superior experience on every level.

I realize now the only reason I enjoyed it before was because I was playing with friends. The game doesn't stand up on its own.
Pros: well-supported co-op mode, dynamic combat system, sense of progression, variety of skills, one song at the end of a particular quest line
Cons: story and writing is (mostly) bad, unfun spikes in difficulty, 'cheesing' some encounters is often the optimal and expected strategy, looting and inventory management is a massive pain if playing by oneself
I wish there was a mixed recommend, because this game has a lot going for it. i certainly recommend if you have friends who want to play with you. 
The one song I mention as a pro is actually what made me realize what the game's story lacked: heart. The writing simply isn't high enough quality to allow for much investment in the world or (most) of the characters. It sucks, because I really tried to get into the lore, reading the books and talking through all dialogue options with anyone I met. It was wasted effort. Reading  a wiki summary of the characters and world is more likely to entertain than the actual writing in the game.

Now having beat the game with my 4 mates, I'd like to catalog the journey we went through.

I'd like to start by saying that this game literally took just over a year to beat, due to the fact that we have very conflicting ways of playing a CRPG. While funny, this would lead to big break intervals in our playthrough and I definitely missed/forgotten a lot of the experiences. This doesn't change that this is one of my favourite games ever made however.

Now to begin; the aforementioned happened in the first 45 hours or so of playtime, this was after leaving Fort Joy, I never mentioned the experiences there... So,

Learning of what's to become of us, we tried to rough up almost every noble/soldier who was assumed as the opposition, leading to a lot of resets (lol) - moments before departing Fort Joy, we do a major fight on the docks, we were being massacred having not only being at level, so there was challenge to the fight, but massively outnumbered. Odds were looking slim, then suddenly, a great void worm emerged from the ground, which context wise, was after us for story elements I'll not disclose. Somehow though, this worm single handely shifted the fight in our favour by taking the aggro of all the enemy NPC's, and likewise, had it's aggro on them. The worm made short work of majority of the enemies but sadly was put to rest by the little remaining. In honour of this worm, we dubbed him ""Chuck"". He will be remembered. 

After arriving to the next destination, we steadily progressed through the campaign, however along the way, doing some side stories, one of my mates finds this Phoenix egg, we had the option to sell it for a decent chunk of cash, or keep it and let it hatch later on. Unanimously we kept it as we'd thought we'd have a pet. Nothing came of it (yet), only for it to be important later, which I'll come back to.

Timeskip a fair few hours into our playthrough, one of my mates decide to ally with the God King, a big mistake. While he was offered immense power, it was limited, along with being binded by a contract in which he'd be considered evil. Us not knowing of this were baffled by the continuous challenge presented as this same friend was the persuasionist of the party, leading to all of the worst dialogue options. Later we removed this binding from him and things seemed good.

Now to the end of the game, we were there, at the end of the game, we endure a tough fight all in order to achieve the story goal. Something happened though. There was a choice. What ending did we want for our journey? Having mixed decisions, the game put us into a fight to the death in order to see who was strong and determined enough to seek out what they thought was just. My friend and I ended up without discussion, choosing the same option, which teamed us against our two other friends. They chose different options form each other, which pitted us in a 2v1v1. The fight was glorious, as we had a big advantage being damage dealers and tanks, while they were more glass cannon types. They were massacred. 

Then came the end of the game, we done it. A year and 3 month journey was concluded. All excited we finish, we were regrouped in a hub area, with all of our allies we made along the way congratulating us. A ally we didn't recognise until interacting with it was the newly hatched Phoenix egg, which had a flaming chook with us. 3 of us were talking about how cool it was to bring this guy along with us for so long while he was still in egg form, while talking about this, one of my friends had other plans. With quick succession, he leaped into the air, bow drawn, and fires an arrow into the Phoenix, killing it upon impact. Our friend lasted mere seconds upon that happening.

Overall, this game was incredible. I haven't experienced anything like this as it was my first co-op CRPG, and ultimately led me to getting into DnD and Larian's recently released Baldur's Gate 3. I can without a doubt place this in my all time favourite gaming experiences ever - 10/10",True

A: Achievements.

The pros:
- Turn-based instead of cancerous RTwP;
- Co-op;
- Good voice acting;
- Decent visuals for cRPG. 

Now, the cons:
- Almost non-existent plot with rocky pacing (final part was done in a hurry because devs were running out of money and it shows);
- Extremely forgettable characters;
- Custom character has no content so you're stuck with playing as an Origin character If you don't want to feel like your MC is out of place;
- Balance still sux in some cases, even with all the fixes of Definitive Edition there are still weird difficulty spikes;
- No roleplaying since you are required to go murderhobo because of XP. If your map isn't covered in bodies at the end of each Act you'll in for a bad time because of aforementioned balance issues; 
- Awful inventory management;
- On top of that, Diablo loot system which means you have to be buried in your inventory 24/7;
- No sense of progression other than numerical (diablo loot system strikes again) since you're too dependent on your armour, rather than skills;
- Main feature (elemental and other surfaces) goes from nice mechanic to overbearing shtick really fast;
- Despite 'go anywhere' narrative the game is pretty linear since every map is divided into areas with a corresponding level attached to them, so little to none variety in quest order. Playthroughs will be the same (unless you cheese, which isn't my cup of tea).

All in all, subpar experience. Wouldn't recommend unless you desperately need an RPG for co-op.",False

I really like the world, I really enjoy the game, but even after playing it for over 100hrs I can't bring myself to finish it.

Enemies from Act 2 onwards constantly break the rules of combat, they have almost no cooldowns on their spells. 
Every battle is spamming save-load to see what unfair trick turn which enemy got from the developers.
------------------
I don't mind overthinking the game and the battles, but for every enemy at the same level as you to have huge advantages in the form of infinite moves, infinite summons or insanely high attacks - it just gets old after a while.
------------------
Practically every battle since Act 2 has had its - ""Haha we caught you!"" moment. If you can't read the future you have to lose the battle - reload your saved position - change your gear and skills - and try again. 
I wouldn't mind that at all - IF IT WASN'T IN EVERY BATTLE.
------------------
For most quests, I have to google their solutions - because the game log is absolutely worthless. There is no way to know what is completed, what is important, what is unimportant. Horrible.

The new armor system is a complete oversight. It's not fun it's just annoying.
------------------
It breaks my heart because I know a lot of love and care went into the game - but I can't recommend it even after playing it for over 100 hours. The game gets worse and worse towards the end.

I had no previous experience with Armored Core games, but i played all ""Souls"" (ds1, 2, 3, bloodborne, Sekiro and Elden Ring) except for Demon Souls.

This is definitely not a Soulslike game, but the Fromsoft ""signature"" is all over the place, in many design elements and how boss fights play.

Once you familiarize with the controls they feel smooth and natural. Missions are generally short and exploration is encouraged with extra gear, (sometimes hidden) mini bosses and lore items. The game is divided in 5 chapters, each with a powerful, epic Main Boss at the end.

Half the game is playing around with your mech build, testing weapons and parts to suit your playstyle (and/or to figure out the best counters for the mission)

Combat is of course excellent, it never gets old and it's incredibly fun. The story is presented via audios from the game's different characters , with top notch voice acting , and it's great. To fully experience the game you need to finish the game three times and follow certain choices in order to get the ""true ending "", so a guide to follow on the third playthrough is highly recommended.

Taking apart your robot and putting it back together with cool new stuff, then dominating AI controlled smack-talking augmented humans.

I personally greedily charged through to NG++ to experience the full story and get my hands on certain goodies, and still want more.

My only complaint is the color palette of the environment. It's pretty bland. I understand that it's a post-apocalyptic warzone, but still, a little bit of color couldn't hurt. At least you can customize your AC to whatever color you want.

for me hard part started after raven boss fight i just can't understand how first version of balteus was so hard for many players, i also finished games (all 3 endings) without shotguns so i don't really understand meta videos of AC6 videos like ""meta build in armored core 6"" it's not elden ring there no meta build play as you like if you have nice reaction even thousand missile won't be a problem for you.",True

I myself am a keyboard and mouse player, so I technically have no clue how this game is on controller, but I'd guess that controller would be the better experience. The UI appears to have a lot going on at first, but once you figure out what is what, it honestly seems really simple and easy to understand, though this may just be a personal thing for me. Ultimately I'd say the best thing you can do to determine if you want to play the game is watch someone play the tutorial mission, then if you want to buy the game, do the tutorial mission, and decide if you want to refund or continue from there.

,148068680,This game is definitely a lot of fun but it's not the most straight forward game in the world. It is a Fromsoft Title which means some of it's missions can be a bit esoteric and Not exactly what I'd call balanced. However it has very straight forward controls and with tinkering you can master it easily. Now I've never played any former AC games so I cannot say how it compares but from what a big AC fan friend said to me it largely plays like an AC game with no 'bad end' from poor financial management so it mostly focuses on the story by comparison. Which to me is one of the games strongest aspects. The story and characters of Rubicon are some of the strongest I've encountered in all my years of gaming.

The sound tracks for the game were a bit on the weaker side in my opinion though it felt like they were mostly used to set ambiance more then anything. But other then that i loved everything else about the game.

To those complaining about the game looking ugly because the war torn and tattered planet didnt look pretty go back to breath of the wild. 

To those complaining about the game being hard or janky. pay attention to the tutorial and learn how to quick boost.

All that being said this can be a pretty acquired taste for some folk with the way the game presents its characters and story so be sure to do a little research if you think the presentation of the game might be a deal breaker. as for me personally i'd give the game a solid 8/10 and will definitely be delving deeper into other armored core titles.",True

game is good though!",True
,145405602,"This is my subjective, personal, totally biased opinion as a person who has no interest in PVP.
In short:
Game's around a 7/10. A good game which is most of the time fun to play. I dislike some mechanics though.
It's a mix between AC4, which I loved and AC5, which I strongly disliked. In the Beginning there are a few big roadblocks, but after you clear Balteus it opens up and is more accessible. Since Patch 1.2 this should not be an issue anymore.

In long:
I strongly dislike most of the bosses.
I am indifferent to the story.
The soundtrack is uninspired and bland, especially if you compare it to the OST of other mech games like AC4 For Answer or Brigador.
The repair mechanic is bad. It's just in the game because mission design is out of whack. A desperate attempt to make light weight and high weight mechs viable for all missions by removing one of their defining features. This does not translate to pvp since repair kits are not available in arena fights.
The stun mechanic could have been left out, but it's not too bad I guess. It has it's ups and downs. It ruins the boss design for me though. Plus I could swear sometimes AI controlled crafts are unable to be stunned out of some animations. Could be wrong about that one though.
Still, in combination with other choices in game design the stun mechanic invalidates long range combat. At least it's not as bad as Pulse shields I guess. 
The refill stations are a bad solution for the problem, that mission length and enemy health are not compatible with the health pool and ammo capacity of your AC. Also they ruin the surprise for most boss battles.
After reviewing some footage, helicopter bosses (for me at least) reside around 40% of the time out of bounds. Now that wouldn't be too much of a problem, but in this iteration of AC these are impassible mission walls. Quite immersion breaking in my opinion. And the moment that your laser blade is blocked by an invisible wall, a few centimetres/inches before it can reach the stunned aircraft? Now that's really sad.
The debt mechanic is as good as gone. That's been a trend for a long time now. I still am slightly miffed about it.
Checkpoints add to make the game more accessible for newer players and the do reduce some of the glaring problems in regards of the mission design. I quite like them.
Gun play is really fun. Especially in the arena or against MTs.
Energy blades now have a separate energy pool from your AC. Reduces the impact of your chosen generator when using them. I am indifferent about that change.
Pulse shielded Enemies can go away though. Very strong dislike. Give me back my PA please. I do miss me my passive war crimes. PA shields were a way better solution by combining stun and pulse shields in a single mechanic. Do you remember the odd missions where PA was deactivated? Not gonna happen anymore.
I miss my stabilizers too. Those were fun.
OC Tuning is... not Tuning anymore? And why are basic functions locked behind OS Tuning? Why do I need to invest OC points so I can manually purge weapon systems? When the ammo is used up I can drop my weapon just fine.
Why do I need money to respec my OC Points? I know the amount is negligible, but that makes it even more obvious that any amount of money isn't needed. If your different AC designs use different OC tuning you need to pay money and manually respec your OC points. I need to admit that I don't know if the OC setting is saved anywhere but honestly? Why? I mean, really. Why would you do that? 
Oh yeah, by play through 3 you have enough OS points to have every perk. That was really dissapointing.
Back to perks where I wonder why they are an unlock: Why am I able to punch without problems, but Kicking needs OC tuning? Why do I need to spend OC points to fast turn? At least by unlocking Assault armor via OC Points, it is now separate from your generator. But it also has an ammo count now. It's a slight dislike/ I am indifferent?

Sound effects are really nice though.
Graphics are really good.
Art direction is really nice too. Some may find the lack of color bad, but I think it's quite fitting to highlight colorful ACs and Coral effects.
I only had one crash until now, so I think it's really stable. Frame rate is quite stable too.
I hope the game will be tweaked in future updates and or future titles. And I also hope that the coming DLC policy will not screw us over. I am carefully optimistic about that one.
That's all I can think of right now. Hope it helps.


p.S. What are the requirements to S Rank for the mission ""Attack the refuling base""? I just can't get it.",True
,148043962,its good for my first in the series,True
,148043077,"Pros:
- Some of the missions have really fun objectives and premises
- Difficulty balance feels just right for the genre (not nearly as hard as say sekiro or souls but also not a game where you can be mindless)
- Some really cool looking environments
- The sound design is very satisfying
- Combat and movement feel real slick
- The game is a tweaker's paradise 
- The part variety does an excellent job allowing for players to satisfy a wide variety of mech fantasies
- Straight to the point game design with very little fat or padding
- The amount of characterization done with the limited time Fromsoft has to develop them is simply incredible. There are a good variety of characters in this game that I ranged from caring deeply about, to hating, to loving to dunk on/screw with.
- The NG+ loop(s) really show you how much better an AC pilot you've become and the missions with in were some of the best in the game

Cons:
- The sound track had some bangers in it, but it was mostly kind of mid/forgettable
- I would have loved it if there were just a few more parts as the parts list feels a bit lighter than prior AC games
- Multiplayer for the game isn't super fun. Alot of folks just use the same not fun builds and there isn't really any game mode variety to spice it up. Mostly just an occasional distraction.
- With so much content in the NG+ loop(s) of the game I kind of just wish that From had most or all of that content available from the get go and just had the campaign have more branching paths rather than the current system of replaying the old missions to get to the juicy new stuff.
- The game feels like it should have around 2 more bosses

Conclusion:
I had high expectations from one of my favorite game devs bringing back a series I enjoyed from the grave, and I must say fromsoft has met my lofty expectations. AC6 is not by any means a perfect game. But for what it is trying to achieve, it comes pretty darn close. For folks wanting a mecha game where you get to customize and tune to your heart's content AC6 is your game. For folks who want slick mecha combat that feels good no matter if you are some lumbering behemoth that is armed to the teeth or a nimble wasp, AC6 has got you covered. On top of us getting both of these things, we also get compelling characters in a no nonsense package.",True

,148038082,"That kid, he just wanted his own callsign.

He just wanted to prove himself, and I tore that dream from his clenched fists. He's not the protagonist of this anime, he's not the hero. He's just another target, and it's just another job. But I felt more in that moment, listening to his last words, his lament that all he wanted was to keep up with a real mercenary, than I did in the entire twelve and a half minutes of frustration, dodging and mindless slaughter involved with taking down the massive piece of The Game Awards 2023 bait that was the STRIDER.

---------------

I'm late to the party on this analysis, but I'm glad I at least figured out what it was I wanted to say eventually. 

I think the main problem with this game, on first blush, was that From needed a way to draw in the Souls crowd, so they threw a whole bunch of fat health bar heavily armored non-humanoid/tetrapod mechs at you during ""story"" missions so that you could feel like you were slaying some great and terrible monster and ease you into the idea that this game is built different. And yeah, there's some big setpiece bosses that kinda irritate me like the STRIDER or the fight where you fly endlessly through a swarm of warships or other stuff that's not really fighting other AC units, but once I got the entire scope and breadth of the game under my belt I realized that they're really a very small part of a much bigger experience. Every fight in the game that *matters*, that you really need to care about (except for the Ice Worm), is against other AC units, and they NEVER blue-ball you and put you against one of these fat healthbar setpiece bosses when some major decision is on the line or you're experiencing the consequences of one of those decisions. Instead, they always throw you at some amped-up form (or in some cases just a really well-piloted version) of a machine that yes, you absolutely can build -- albeit later, in a heavily neutered form.

That's kind of an issue, I guess. The old AC games let you go ham with the busted ridiculously powerful parts or do things like create energy-neutral machine builds that let you hover indefinitely because your energy regeneration outpaced your usage, and stuff like that. I've seen a lot of complaints that the hidden weapons and parts in this game are underwhelming, and a lot of speculation that they're underwhelming because From wants there to be balance in PVP fights (hence the inevitable nerf of the Zims and the Stun Needle launcher), and I guess I can see where that's coming from.

Personally, I would just exclude those parts from being used in arena fights or give PVP different stats from single-player, but I'm not From and I'm not really sure if what I've heard matches with reality since I haven't really engaged with the online fighting. I do think it's unusual that your feet have to be firmly planted on the ground for a while in order to start regenerating energy, but I was never too deep into the mechanics of the old AC games to really know or care about that sort of thing and I'm pretty sure most normal people won't care either. If you do, though, that's not a bad thing; you've just probably got a laundry list of other complaints that I'm not interested in covering here and wouldn't really think too hard about even if I did know about them.

As far as tech goes, the game's running good on my machine but I've, like a lot of the other ""works on my PC"" guys who have been upping this game, got an unfairly good spec, so I feel like that's not going to help the people with real problems. I hope patches fix this; for the most part, it appears that From is listening to player concerns. I have no doubts that further improvements will come.

Despite my complaints, I had a real fun time with this game. It feels to me like a return to form with the general style of AC2 and AC3's controls and less of the heart-bursting high speed fights that I don't think I could handle now from AC4. I don't really like the setpiece missions, but I do like the man-to-man duels a lot and the fun twists the game throws at you when you're repeating missions on the second and third playthrough. I don't think there'll be any post-launch content for this game. Maybe that's a good thing. It's certainly a very complete package as-is, and I'm glad for it.

Also, From achieved the impossible and managed to make me care about the cast of characters in one of their games instead of just one meme character or whoever the level-up waifu is.

First of all, this is my first official experience with the Armored Core franchise. And I must say, as a newcomer this is one of the most amazing action mecha experiences I've ever had.

- The handling and feel of controlling the AC just feels so right. Smooth, intuitive, and reactive, it really felt like an extension of my hands on my controller. 

- Rewarding action gameplay and combat. Yes the difficulty is there, but it's done tastefully. Each encounter and skill benchmark you run into truly feels like a test of your combat experience, skills, and knowledge of your AC build.

- Interesting and memorable characters. YES even though they're faceless, they all oozed with personality just from their dialogue and voices (I played in English voices).

- The AC customization was in depth but still user-friendly enough to not overwhelm me. You 'll get all the weapons and parts you need and immediately know how to put them together to create a build that suits your preferred playstyle. Aside from 1 or 2 bosses that require a specific build to beat, you can totally beat them all with your own custom builds.

- A story that doesn't give away too much too soon and leaves a lot for your to discover as you progress through the game. Nothing  mind-blowing, but it serves as a great backdrop for the game's main focus: the mecha combat.

,148008863,"If you are looking a good mecha game, THIS IS IT.

really pretty to look at (scenarios, mechs, explosions), mecha is fully customizable, runs surprisingly good even with just above min specs, responsive controls, free ominidirectional movement (very anime-like), HUGE explosions, memorable boss fights, arena fights, the difficulty is really up to you and how effective you pilot your own custom made ass-whooping machine. 

the only downside: storytelling is mid at best, the real seller is the smooth gameplay. 

Personally, the mission-based story gave me a ""2000s"" vibe.

Ost is disappointing, 90% of it is unmemorable droning while the other 10% is really good. unfortunately no FreQuency songs either. I feel like the classic AC music genre from gen3 and gen4 would have fit well.

No parts like weapon arms, sniper cannons, or back chain guns. No shoulder parts either, though that is fine, as they werent as important. Only 2 quad legs and only 3 tank legs, what the fuck? Only 1 semi auto rifle (I count linears as snipers).

Also long range combat is non-existent, everything ricochets off at about 350 meters.

Everything else in the game is amazing, combat feels great, story is good and it is fun as hell.",True
,146238051,"Let me start it off by saying,
[h1]I don't like Armored Core 6.[/h1]

That's right. I am not happy with this game- or rather, as ""Armored Core"". 

By the way, don't take my play time as a reference since I mostly spent those time making waifu decals and meme builds. 

On the previous review, I simply noted as ""do not recommend"" complaining how NOT armored core this game is- and I still stand by to say that the game essentially is the reskinned Sekiro-You are [u]not[/u] playing as a pilot of the mech, but you play as the mech, if you know what I mean. And please, it has estus flask...or should I call it ""mechstus flask"", that's straight from souls series.

However, after playing some more and put some thoughts to it... I felt that it wasn't fair.

Allow me to just get rid of the negative sides, because I got plenty of those.

Your mech build barely contribute to your play style but rather by your weapons. Even that is restricted by overwhelmingly emphasized ""stagger mechanic"", which restrict most of your weapon choices to being short distance such as shotgun being overpowered. [b]Let me add on the fact that the game does not offer sniper build, which is something that was there for the entirety of series[/b]

Unlike past game, most of the ""customization"" comes as an upgrade instead of some way of expanding your build or exploring different strategy. In the older series including 5th gen, generators are either made for nimble light weight but low power output, or a heavy tank with high power output. You can of course mix together but must overcome the consequence of such build, as light weight would not be able to hold much weight, therefore sacrifices weapon load out. AC6 does offer something similar, but not as exciting fashion. It just tells you that you need to upgrade xxx parts if you want yyy to be upgraded. Kind of like getting a new car for a Need for Speed, why would you use 90s sports sedan if you have modern lambo now, besides making it as a challenge?

There are many aspects of the game that really tried to reuse some of the movement assets from souls series. Humanoid boss battles are quite notable, as it doesn't move like a machine at all- it's like seeing a robot forming a [i]kamehameha pose[/i] before shooting a laser. If you're a robot, you know you could just pull the trigger.

Overall, you can definitely feel that this wasn't a ""major breakthrough from souls series"" as Fromsoft made exclusively the same genre of game for a decade, but attempt to yet again reuse the same formula in a totally different game that doesn't mix well. 

[h2]So why would I recommend it, if I didn't like it?[/h2]

Well, 2 major reasons. 1, because of stupid Steam® rating system. 2. because I can tell the effort they tried to put in, despite its problems.

First of all, they needed to make bunch of new models, as none of the older games had scifi-mech 3D models. Maybe trees could be reused, but that was about it. You can tell that these aren't cheap models either, as it has variety of motions in each parts. For example, each core has its unique animation for their cooling mechanic. 

You can also find many references to an old series, like ""Patches"" character showing up, which actually first introduced in 4th gen, before Dark Souls. Some game mechanics are straight from old gen. Shields are nice welcoming return from 2-3 gen, but more functional. You also saw the cinematic trailer, probably, and those aren't cheaply done either. That 1 large scaled boss fight, Strider,  was truly impressive.

And then... you find lack of parts. Why are so many redundancy in biped, while offering very little on different parts like reverse, quad, and tanks? If customization is so important, you would think that they would add more variety in parts, right? 

My guess is... they ran out of budget and time. I have a feeling that making Armored Core costed way more than any of the recent games that From released, at least from marginal profit aspect (games sold - cost to make game = marginal profit). 
Elden ring is more polished souls game that could carry over directly from older series to reuse many assets that it had, so they could spend more time on building the game mechanic, which was open world setting. The game was also hyped by MANY people and did sell very very well. Armored Core needed a lot of things had to be made new instead of focusing on core game system, which makes me believe why the game feels so close to souls game than any of the Armored Core series. It also makes sense why the lack of complexity in mech build as well as part variety with over redundancy of biped legs. 

Of course, I haven't done a thorough research on this theory so this is solely a hypothesis. I would love to hear other's thought about this.

Before the update, game balance was total wack. Some bosses were way too difficult, and some weapons were game breakingly strong. Now, some updates balanced out the weapons and boss fight, it's actually quite enjoyable.

I was upset before about the game because I thought Fromsoft made Armored Core as a cashgrab, by slapping Armored Core title on souls game. Now, though, I realized how wrong I was. Armored Core was never a major title that brought people's attention, and making whole bunch of new models would costed more than they could sell for. I now think Armored Core 6 as a passion project that became out of their hand and needed to be sold prematurely. 

So I'm recommending this game solely because I want Fromsoft to stop making souls game. I want them to be different. I want Fromsoft to make another mech game with the assets they have made. Maybe Armored Core 6.5. For that, they need their game to be sold. 1 positive review wouldn't do a shit to their sales, but negative one wouldn't help even more.",True

i was kinda irked at first when i knew there were multiple ending barring access to content, but the fact that mission design made me complete it while loving it the entire time is a testament to the game design.
1st, 2nd and 3rd playthoughs are completely different, bosses and missions that were hard at 1st were manageable on 2nd and down right easy on 3rd.

This all being said, the game does have its faults. biggest one being that I have no idea what is happening in the story.
",True
,147994713,"I can't believe how good Armored Core 6 is.  Like, From has to miss eventually, right?  I figured this was time, they were going to stray from the Souls formula that has guided them through their recent success, and they were going to misstep, trying to revive a franchise from yesteryear.  Like, I did not think that AC6 was going to be bad or anything, I just didn't think it was going to be the best game of 2023.  I was wrong.  

Armored Core feels so good.  It took me a little bit to be entirely comfortable fighting, but once I got there, the wait was worth it.  I would end up in these crazy fights with missiles and things flying everything from every direction, yet felt fully in control and capable of dodging and retaliating.  It feels new and refreshing, it does not have the rhythm of the usual character action game attack, doge/parry, attack.  You are incredibly mobile and you are tanky, a few stray hits here and there mean nothing.  

In service to getting comfortable, there are a massive amount of mech parts and weapons.  While somewhat complicated at first, the systems are pretty easy to grok, and once you have played the game for a bit you will start to figure out how you like to play and what loadouts make sense for you.  You can customize your mech down to very small details, paint it different colors, add decals, various levels of wear or shine, etc.  It all looks great.  

In From tradition, AC6 is steeped in melancholy and despair, it permeates the entire game.  The lore is interesting, some things only hinted at.  While mostly an action game, there are some lore chests to be found, and some hidden optional battles that give more information as well.  The actual lives of the humans on Rubicon is never seen and almost never spoken about.  The Coral, the finding of it, the mining of it, the controlling of it, and the elimination of it seem to be the only things that matter.   Its so oppressive, it only feels natural that many of your allies and enemies seem to welcome death when it comes.  Personally, I was fascinated the entire time.  

The games visuals are perfect.   The mechs are incredibly detailed and interesting, the world has some spectacular ruins and vistas.   The game ran butter smooth on my 3060ti at 60fps, making combat so fluid and enjoyable.  

In order to play every mission, see everything, and unlock everything you need to play through the game three times.  Normally I would scoff at this, but the game is so great in every aspect, I was thrilled to play more.  I may even dabble in the online multiplayer at some point, although I haven't yet.

,147992415,"I was a fan of the series since gen1 back in 97 I was just a kid then, and I didn't understand anything.
Coming from that experience, I really like AC6 as an introduction to the franchise.
It's really easy to pick up, but after that the difficulty is up to the player. Sure, you can play a METAGolem, but where this game really shines, for me at least, is in making that cool build and making it work. Your preferred build won't always work, so there will always be adjustments to be made, where the player's skill fails them.

The story isn't as buried as it can be in other Souls games. It is worth experiencing in its entirety, with some cool a-ha moments I had going through NG+ and NG++.

I personally dont like the boss fights, but thats kina OK since it seems to be the intention of the game.
Would be great though, if you could change difficulty, like in nearly every other game.
First boss I was biting my tabel until I got lucky. Thats not the experience I was looking for.

At least there is a checkpoint before a bossfight and you can change your loadout and retry.
You can not go to the shop though. So if you only got 1 set of gear, you have to abort, buy alternative gear and retry.

Some of the missions are very short. (5minutes or less) Main story missions are longer though.

The ammount of one hit kills or stunlock mechancis that kill you with super accurate hits out of the literal blue is astonishing. *looking at you death lasers from the sky

Everything in the game outside combat makes you wait. Getting into the hangar after a mission: *pause ""you have 2 new messages"" *pause *pause ""story related message"" *pause *pause ""system message there is new gear"" *pause

Every of the first sorties start with a short brief of your handler that doesnt add a single bit of info and just wastes about 30 seconds of your time. These pre and post briefing comments also not immersive also, so that reason is out of the window too.

Levels get re-used. Even if the map is tiny, you can bet at least 2 sorties present at the same time, play on the same map. Maybe you start on the other end but thats all.

The game itself is very easy to get into, yet hard to master, and it is easy to start the series from here story- wise. The story isn't presented to you in the way it might be in a story-driven game like The Last of Us. The only visuals we get for characters are their emblem, and an AC, if they have one, letting you decide what they look like.

Gameplay wise, it shares many elements with the Ace Combat series: Each mission is presented to you in the menu, you get a briefing on what to expect, and then you go shoot giant robots. 

PvP is hosted in rooms, and has 1v1 and 3v3 options. It doesn't seem like an afterthought, but it left me a little confused when I first got into it, simply because of the lack of a ""Find Match"" button. 

Weapons feel great, and are well balanced for both PvE and PvP, though some guns have perhaps needlessly low ammo counts.

[h1][b]I Only Died Twice[/b][/h1]

Not surprised this game won GOTY in 2019, level design, combat and boss fights are probably one of the best of the games I've played. is it harder than dark souls, bloodborne. elden ring? idk, some bosses are harder than other souls but in other souls games the area is also hard while sekiro is not too hard (maybe because of the grapling hook) but there is Noble Mist. This boss is just as hard as Soldier of Godrick, I probably died about 2187152 times against him.

[b]Pros[/b]
[list]
[*] Combat, probably the best i've ever experienced
[*] Arts and Ninjutsu is pretty cool
[*] Deflecting is an orgasm for ears
[*] Great traversal mechanics
[*] Replayability (like other souls game)
[*] English and Japanese voices is actually pretty great, but some characters I prefer Japanese. Play whichever you like (spantol is goat languages)
[*] Unlike other souls game, in sekiro you only lose half experience and money
[*] Resurrection
[*] Multiple endings
[*] Protagonist can talk
[*] Only 12 Gb
[*] Area design is so damn gorgeous
[*] Swimming
[*] Diving
[/list]
[b]Neutral[/b]
[list]
[*] Story, nothing special for me other souls game has better lore
[*] Prosthetic tools, useful and useless at the same time
[*] Music
[/list]
[b]Cons[/b]
[list]
[*] NO PHOTOMODE
[*] Stealth, is not that good
[*] Same model bosses 
[*] you return to the same area 3 times to progress the story with different enemy types (2 times for the bad ending)
[/list]
i know its hard, just play you'll get better and better. Definitely worth 100%

,147534589,"I absolutely and entirely love Sekiro. I played it first, ahead of all the other From Software games -- I was told that if I play the DS games first, I'd have to unlearn mechanics to get through Sekiro. So I just went ahead and played it first.

It was incredibly hard -- every single boss gave me a tough time and I ended up cheesing as many as I could. But as I played the game, I realized that learning the mechanics is actually extremely rewarding. And by the time I reached the final boss, I was totally enamored. Play through #2 was delightful -- all those mechanics I learned taught me just how satisfying the game was meant to be.

About 6 months after I finished the game (aka all steam achievements), I kind of wanted to give it a try again. And this is where it REALLY took off for me. I did everything I didn't bother doing the first time -- NG+1 to +7, Demon bell + No kuro's charm, gauntlets + all those item and enemy randomizer mods. It was nothing short of incredible. How can the same game be so rewarding to keep replaying? How can the same boss fights be so much fun when they're harder? Not sure really. I've played through DS1 since then and while that was fun, Sekiro is what I keep returning to.

I've gotten as much out of this game as I've gotten out of Hollow Knight (and that's a whole fricking lot).

TL;DR: Some of the most satisfying gameplay mechanics I have ever seen in a game. It's difficult, but fair. You need to get good at the mechanics to progress, but when you do, it is utter bliss.

,61705198,"This game has the most satisfying melee combat mechanics of any game I have ever played. The deep enemy design is a classic staple of Fromsoftware nowadays and is even better than ever in Sekiro - as the game has been designed entirely around your set of tools. 

[b] Weapons [/b]
With a more concise toolset than previous Fromsoft games, your weapons are better integrated into the combat. You have katana as your main offensive and defensive weapon throughout the game. In your off-hand you have nothing, briefly, until your hand is literally sliced off; then, you acquire a prosthetic limb with tools that add lots of spice to the combat. Your prosthetics range from shurikens to flamethrowers and they all fill certain useful niches.

[b] Enemies [/b]
I loved the vast majority of enemy designs in Sekiro. There are very few enemy designs that I was not a fan of. Namely the Headless', who I will return to later. The Snake Eyes' had a little too limited a moveset to be worth being put in twice too. The Ogre is a good tutorial on dodging but isn't that interesting to fight, in my opinion. The Demon of Hatred feels like playing a Souls boss in Sekiro; it's alright but not as fun to fight as the other bosses, even with its incredible visual design and moveset animations.

[b] Adventure[/b]
The world design is beautiful and fun to explore, and again in typical 'Soulslike' fashion you can see certain landmarks in the distance which eventually turn out to be levels you can visit (albeit not as much as in previous titles). Some of the levels in this game are the most beautiful I've seen in the Souls genre and are worth progressing to blind.

[b] Combat [/b]
This is the first Soulslike FS made with a jump, and it goes high - but it has a little wind up so you can't abuse it too much for evasion in tight combat scenarios - you will need to rely mostly on deflection instead. Deflection involves a well timed block which will damage your opponent's posture. Once you damage your opponent's posture enough to break it you can inflict a fatal blow that finishes off weaker opponents. This system cleverly pushes players into more active and risky combat as players who engage with it will defeat opponents in under half the time it'd take to stab and slash their standard HP to 0.

[b] Headless [/b]
The headless, as I mentioned earlier, are optional horror creatures that will pull your soul out of your arse if they kill you. They block your dodge and build up ""terror"" (an instakill debuff) on every non perfect deflect. some headless are underwater and  with these even perfect deflects build up terror. It feels unfair to critique them for this though, as they are not designed to be a standard and fair fight - they are purely optional and very easy to avoid if you want to. That said, I like to fight everything in these games so I wasn't a fan of these guys.

[b] Story [/b]
Speaking of other changes to the standard design, Sekiro's story is more hands-on than previous Soulslike titles. I don't have much to say about it, it was a decent story. I'm ambivalent to the story. I haven't watched as many lore videos about Sekiro as I have the other Souls games so perhaps its more hands on nature has made me a little less interested in its story.

[b] Conclusion [/b]
All in all, this game is incredible. If you're already a fan of the Souls genre you should give this a try. It will take a little bit of adjusting to but if you stick with it you'll learn to love it. For newer players or those unfamiliar with the Souls genre and are feeling a little intimidated by the difficulty - if you have the grit to overcome its challenge and improve your skills, this game will reward you massively for it. It's a power fantasy that you earn, which (imo) feels so much better than games that just give you a power fantasy.",True

,147437268,"""Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice"" is an absolute masterpiece of a game that sets a new standard for action-adventure titles. FromSoftware, the developers behind iconic titles like Dark Souls and Bloodborne, have truly outdone themselves with this exceptional creation.

One of the most striking aspects of Sekiro is its breathtaking world design. The game's setting, a beautifully realized feudal Japan, is a visual feast filled with intricate details and atmospheric environments. From serene cherry blossom-covered landscapes to dark, foreboding castles, every location feels like a work of art.

The gameplay is where Sekiro truly shines. The combat system is both elegant and brutal, requiring precise timing, strategy, and a mastery of the game's mechanics. The protagonist's arsenal of deadly samurai tools and the ability to parry and counter attacks make each battle an exhilarating dance of death. The difficulty curve is steep, but the sense of accomplishment when you conquer a challenging boss is unparalleled.

The story of Sekiro is a captivating tale of revenge and redemption, woven into the fabric of the game's world. The protagonist, Wolf, is a silent but compelling character whose journey is filled with intriguing NPCs and memorable interactions. The narrative is delivered in a subtle and immersive way, allowing players to piece together the lore as they progress.

Visually, the game is a work of art, with meticulous attention to detail in character design, animations, and environmental textures. The lighting and sound design further enhance the immersion, creating a world that feels alive and teeming with danger.

Sekiro also boasts an outstanding musical score that perfectly complements the on-screen action. From haunting melodies during tense moments to the adrenaline-pumping battle themes, the soundtrack adds another layer of depth to the overall experience.

In conclusion, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is a gaming masterpiece that combines breathtaking visuals, challenging gameplay, a compelling story, and superb craftsmanship. It's a game that demands dedication and skill but rewards players with an unforgettable journey through a beautifully realized world. For fans of FromSoftware's previous works or anyone seeking a gaming experience that pushes the boundaries of what's possible in the medium, Sekiro is an absolute must-play. This game sets a high watermark for the action-adventure genre, and it will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the greatest games of its generation.",True

Most Annoying Cons:-
- The STEALTH in this game is not great, sometimes you don't get spotted when you kill a guy standing right next to another guy and other times you get spotted through walls, enemies forget you exists even after you kill someone in front of them, alerting one enemy somehow alerts everyone in the whole area instantly.
- The camera is just classic FromSoftware shit, get in a corner and u won't be able to see the enemy, closed spaces will be extremely annoying when fighting agile enemies.
- The target lock is also extremely annoying when the enemy jumps over you and it releases on its own.",True

,147425989,"several years later this is still the best gameplay experience offered by FS: combat punishes you for not being good, without artificial cheats to make the game ""harder"". cheesing is not an option, enemy attacks are not tracking movement unless it is consistent with the laws of physics and input reading is used in the most balanced way possible. on this side some exceptions are present but are so scarce and sporadic they get a pass. after elden ring, seeing bosses having actual down times or openings after big damage/reckless attacks, not having 10+ hit combos is a huge plus. With sekiro I never had to wonder why bosses don't use their best move on repeat to win 100% of the time, because there is actual balancing in damage dealt/exertion required from the performer of the attack: this creates windows of opportunity for  retaliation that makes winning a fight consistent and logic. 

lore and world building are solid and are classics from FS in terms of not being 100% clear but you know what you need to enjoy the plot (on this side, dark souls definitely has an edge if you like lore speculation and analysing every small detail).

ultimately one just wonders what went downhill with elden ring's development...",True

,147411771,"Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice marks the fifth FromSoftware title I've had the pleasure of experiencing. My motivation was to test my gaming skills, as Sekiro is widely recognized as FromSoftware's most formidable creation. While I concur that Sekiro's combat is undeniably challenging, I firmly believe that no other game can rival the sheer exhilaration it offers. The indescribable sensation that washes over you when you flawlessly parry and evade a boss's relentless assault is beyond words. Sekiro also boasts an array of unforgettable bosses.

While most of FromSoftware's games are known for their cryptic storytelling, I found Sekiro's narrative surprisingly accessible.

In my opinion, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice deserves a perfect 10/10 rating and is an absolute must-play for any gamer.",True

,147408141,"Combat system 8/10. 
Most bosses 10/10. 
Mini-bosses are cool and 7/10. 

But the world exploration, grind, spirit emblem system is utter trash. 
Combat system only works 1 vs 1. The game rarely offers 1 vs 1 fight outside of boss arena. 
Because of this all areas in this game feel bad, horrible and just atrocious. 
Stealth system doesn't work good, so I just ran past all the enemies. 

The whole game in between bossfights feels bad. 
Areas are looking nice, geometry is great. But when you try to explore, the only thing you find is ""fistful of ash"". This game doesn't have anything to offer a player for exploration. 

Spirit emblems are needed to perform certain skills and to use tools. But it doesn't recover on death like mana in DS3. You have to grind the gold to buy those emblems. And the price rises.

,147394815,"Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is simply phenomenal. This my second game from FromSoftware, the other being Elden Ring.

Even though it is the same developer, these two games could not be more different mechanically I feel.
Sekiro demands of you to meet it at its level of difficulty and master its core mechanic (the combat, and specifically the parry system) in order to beat it.

There is no way around it. You will bang your head against the wall, dying to mobs and bosses, if you do not engage the game in the way it wants you too. It is truly fair in this regard in that your deaths and lack of progress, will be the result of your failures, misjudgment and drop in concentration rather than some unfair bullshit that the game throws at you just to be difficult for difficulty’s sake.

It’s important to say that Sekiro is not perfect in this regard as it has some situations that prompt you to say ""Come on, what the fuck was that???"" but this is such a rarity that it can't possibly cause you to uninstall and say how its unfair garbage meant to needlessly frustrate you and waste your time.

The main takeaway is that the game encourages player growth and when you beat it, it is only because you learned and became better, you fought and earned your victory. No one else.

The only negative I would say is the lack of variety in enemies, even though personally I didn’t mind I can see how someone might get tired of fighting primarily humanoid bosses and mobs. The environments, while beautifully crafted, also suffer from the same problem mentioned above. 
The soundtrack is extremely well composed, evocative of Japan set in the Sengoku period, fitting the games style and themes. Two tracks particularly stand out and you will surely recognize which ones I mean during your play-through.

All in all, I can’t recommend Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice enough. Expertly crafted and challenging in the right way, it will definitely be worth your money and time. And one very important thing to remember: Hesitation is defeat.

Jokes aside, definitly my favourite FromSoft game and I would argue that it's THE BEST souls-like game. Everything just feels smooth and rewarding. No stupid magic, no pyro, if you loose, you know that you are the problem, you know that you can do something better. 
Game has a relatively small room for cheesing bosses, YOU HAVE to become better in order to win. 
No more 2 tons of useless weapons, your katana and all prothetics are useful and serve a purpose instead of being a niche experience. 

I screamed a lot at my first play but boy this game is rewarding like no other. If you win, you know that you deserved it. There is no option for sniping bosses using pyromancies or spells. The only ""easy"" mode that exist is option to stealth kill one hp bar of some bosses, besides that you will need to use your sweat and iron will.

,22890157,"Valve made a massive change to the game that no one asked for and forced it on people by replacing the original game with it.

CS 2 only has a fraction of the maps and game modes that CS:GO had and Valve also deleted all of the old achievements, so if you were like me and proud of your 100% completion of CS:GO, Valve has ever so lovingly told you to go screw yourself.

Additionally in updating the game to CS2, Valve has somehow managed to completely break the near flawless anti-cheat system that was present in CS:GO, meaning the game is now absolutely riddled with hackers and script kiddies.

Not to mention the fact that this update was Valve taking an 11 year old game that ran fine on pretty much any system and replacing it with a game that runs like absolute dog crap unless you have a high end gaming PC. They took a game that people already purchased and made it virtually unplayable on older systems, essentially forcing people to either no longer play a game that they paid for or upgrade their computer to continue playing. Heck, I have a 3070 TI and even I frequently have frame rate issues in CS2, a problem that was non-existent in CS:GO.

Now Valve has said that they're working on updating the remaining maps and gamemodes to CS2, however if all the content wasn't ready then they should have either delayed the release or made it an OPTIONAL beta/DLC instead of replacing the original game with it.

Valve has been making an ever increasing amount of bad decisions in the past couple years and CS2 is one of them.",False

[Updated Oct 24 2023] 
Still no sign of left handed view models. I'm suspecting that Valve now sees mirroring the texture on a first-person view model as an infraction towards the sanctity of weapon skins. 

If Valve allowed me to use a predominately left handed view model while playing again, all of their weapon skins that included text it would look like this ""ӘИIИЯAW"" instead of this ""WARNING"". 

Using left handed view models would ""break"" any merchandise with text on it, and potentially cost Valve the sale of a key or marketplace transaction fee. Taking away the ability to use mirrored view models ensures I can always see the pretty text on expensive things ""the way it was intended"", and remain a possible customer. 

Valve has removed what was to me a core mechanic from the game I paid for many years ago.
I remain dissatisfied until I either get a complete refund for for all the keys and resulting skins I purchased with the intention playing with them mirrored or, ""cl_righthand 0"" is returned. ",False

,148947602,"  I've played CS for over five years, but to be honest I'm tired of the bullshit between players. If you're new to the game, I'd try something else as its population is full of established players who squabble and whine over the game-play of others. There's no words of advice or encouragement to be found and they'll simply treat you as a hindrance to their arrogant mastery of the game. They abuse the voting system to repeatedly attempt to get team-mates ejected from the match or even worse, never stop babbling, so distracting others trying to listen for footsteps. I eventually turned off chat because although it should be enabled for teams to work together, it's just used to call other players. CS2 is a great upgrade and game, but you may as well play with bots, unless you like being shouted at by armchair warriors proffering unsolicited advice from their parents basements. I wouldn't say the fan-base is toxic, but they're way too intolerant of noobs and perhaps have lost context of that CS2 is just a game!",False

,147849429,"Damn, great job copying activsion and their warzone 2. You damn near passed them in the race of the down-grade. CS:GO was better and this update is absolutely fowl.

They are at least attempting to fix some issues like fucked hit boxes but still, you knew we didn't want CS2, yet you still got rid of the original CS:GO and absolutely obliterated the competitive mode so we would play your fucking premier; which we already would have played without the complete butchering of original competetive. Also shit should have been patched before release, just as Cyberpunk2077 learned THE HARD WAY. Don't be the idiot that other people learn from be the genius that learns from the idiots.

It has been a little over a month since CS2 has taken the place of our beloved CS:GO and just a reminder that commitment and doubling down is what left the TF2 team feeling dried out and the game itself in the state it was in durring the bot crisis (which is still a partially present issue). Also dragging hitboxxes that follow the player about a half second behind, an issue most seen in TF2, is prominent in this new and ""improved"" CS2. How do you manage to bring back a 15 year old glitch in to your game that you didn't have in the previous version? If you've ever played ARK, it has a similarly outrageous glitch where the non-dedicated session tethering setting will change the swimming move speed of dinosaurs such as the Moschops and Raptors. Meaning multiplying the extraordinarily small tethering range by 9999x (which barely allowed full movement across the entirety of The Island map, a twenty-something square kilometer map), will in turn multiply the swim speed of a Raptor; an already really fast dinosaur, by 9999x. This 9999x multiplier on swim speed is enough to jump half of the entire length of The Island map just by swimming into a rock. Glitches like these are insane and maybe I don't have enough knowledge on how game code is constructed; but to me these issues just don't make sense to even occur and doubt that it makes any sense to anybody else, especially in a soft remaster of an eleven year old game made by a multi-billion dollar company that is appraised for saving the PC gaming industry.",False

If you get a container, you still have to pay real money to buy a key to open it through steam. I dont like the fact when ADS its toggle no matter what and wish they can add a hold ADS option. Other than those two things I like the game. I have played 13.5hrs in 2 days of install.

,143859732,"Dead Cells: A Masterful Metroidvania
Dead Cells is a roguelike metroidvania that has quickly become one of my favorite games of all time. It's a perfect blend of challenging gameplay, rewarding progression, and addictive atmosphere.

The game's procedurally generated levels are always fresh and exciting, and the combat is fast-paced and brutal. There's a huge variety of weapons and abilities to experiment with, and each run feels different from the last.

I also love the game's sense of progression. As you play, you'll unlock new weapons, abilities, and items that will make you more powerful and help you reach new areas. It's incredibly satisfying to see your character grow stronger over time.

The game's atmosphere is also top-notch. The visuals are dark and atmospheric, and the soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful. It really sucks you into the world of Dead Cells.

The new Return to Castlevania DLC is a great addition to the game. It features new levels, enemies, and bosses that are inspired by the classic Castlevania games. It's a great way to relive some nostalgia, and it also adds some much-needed challenge to the game.

Overall, Dead Cells is a masterpiece. It's a must-play for fans of roguelikes, metroidvanias, or just great games in general. I highly recommend it.",True

The combinations of these elements frequently complement each other. The variety of enemy types encountered throughout the game is refreshingly diverse as you navigate through each level.

,142776709,"Dead Cells is a high speed platformer action game that tries to mash the roguelite and metroidvania genres together. Unfortunately I didn't find the result anything special.

The art is really pretty with high quality animation and detailed pixel art backgrounds, while gameplay is designed to be fast paced with branching paths that take you towards different areas each with their own enemies and bosses to face against. Each step of the way you get access to random upgrades, unlock permanent improvements, and there's a variety of game modifiers. Sadly this game jumps on the 'souls like' train so you know what that means.

Souls-likes always suffer the same problem - every enemy becomes a knowledge-gate instead of a skill-check. There's more to be learned from souls games than just ramping up the volatility but few designers pick up on that and gamers foam at the mouth to be whipping boys for this style of arbitrarily hard gameplay. The result is you either waste weeks learning each knowledge gate or you put the game down and get meme'd on by everyone suffering from sunk cost fallacy - either way there are no true winners.

Overall dead cells feels like it has the potential to be a pretty solid game but squanders it. I can't see the combat design as anything other than lazy and while it tries to make up for it with fast gameplay to get you back in the action this just results in an incredibly repetitive experience without the substance to make investing in it worthwhile.",False

,148478536,""" Thumbs down! What in the h*ll are you doing!""

Easy...easy now. Let me explain. Yes Elden ring is a thumbs down. I have finished DSR, DS2, DS3 and Sekiro before this and i really liked DSR and Sekiro. But when i had reached DS3 midd-game i was starting to get full.
Repetition, repetition and repetition. Learn the the bosses moves and run to the next boss in a game with a 
storyline as dead and lifeless as the statue-like carachters you encounter along the ride.

Elden ring is exactly like the previous games. Yeah yeah it´s open world, you can fast travel and you can craft things. But the fast travel is the only real progression for the series. The open world is completely dead. It´s not like the Witcher world or other open world games. What From soft has done is basically just to smash down all the walls in DS3 and make it big. But it functions just as a filler and adds nothing of value. It´s still just three main things to do in the game, except killing bosses, and that is:

-Collect golden tears, collect sacred tears and collect smithing stones. Just like From softs earlier games. Sure you can run around in the big open world and colllect buffs, ashes of war and other things - but you certainly don´t need to. I chose a strong weapon in the start of the game (by killing an optional boss) and then i upgraded that weapon and collected all the flasks (estus flasks as they were called in previous games) i could find. And that was enough. The bosses were very easy. I killed most of the bosses in under two minutes head to head melee. And after i finished Margott, the omen king i was just as bored as i was when i got to midd-game DS3. But this time i stoped playing. The story is crap, the world is dead and the characters are as lifeless as a brickwall. Kill the boss and head to the next area and kill that boss too. That was enough five to ten years ago. Now its boring and predictable. Like eating corn flakes.

And why should i craft something? I didn´t craft a single item on my journey because i never needed to. And i never used an ash of war to buff my weapon. The crafting, the open world and many of the strengthening armamanet just felt like fillers. Pointless fillers.

Sure, i can see why ppl like the game. Especially ppl that never played From softs earlier games. But for those who know the DS-series should be tired of this by now. There is nothing new to the game. At least nothing that matters.

From software has created a bunch of really good games with the DS-series. But now its time to either evolve or move along. Elden ring felt old really fast.",False

,148585427,"I have never felt so conflicted about a game in my entire life. 
On one hand, the combat is fun and engaging with some amazing boss fights that are incredibly grandiose and epic, but on the other hand, I can not for the life of me get into this world and its story. The more and more I learn about it, the more I just despise it. The vast majority of the bosses are entirely optional and there is not any real motivation or justification to fight them, even among the remembrance bosses seeing as you just have to kill two and it literally does not matter which two since you don't have much motivation beyond getting the great runes you need to progress. A boss should mean more than some equipment and levels.
This world is also just exhausting to play in and explore. It is so massive and just jammed packed with stuff to do and enemies to fight that there is very few places where you can just relax and take a breather. They tried to use the round table hold for this, but it is entirely disconnected from the rest of the world and sometimes just feels like a glorified menu, lacking the comfort of say Firelink Shrine. Also, because of the scale, the few moments of meaningful and fun character interactions are either entirely missable if you aren't looking for them or so scattered they get drowned out by everything else.
Every ending to this game feels meaningless and in the end I am just left asking what was the point of any of it. 
Having only recently beaten Dark Souls 1 for the first time, the contrast between the two games is immense. Few games have captivated me with their world as much as Dark Souls was able to, and it didn't even feel like it was trying to impress me. 
It feels like this game wants you to care.

A great addition to the catalog of any gamer looking for a challenge.
Gorgeous game!
Definitely worth the money even at full cost.

Summons trivialize most fights but are fun to watch them run around. Would recommend to anyone to try to defeat the bosses without spirit ashes first and use them when you get frustrated and feel like you have experienced the boss enough to move on.

In a good percentage of the boss fights it feels like they designed the boss encounters, had playtesters provide data on the attack timings and then offset them all by a half second. Trying to sight-read most of the boss attacks in the game is almost a futile endeavour as so many attacks are timed to roll catch you. It breaks some immersion as the boss holds the giant weapon in the air for 4 seconds providing ample openings for some attacks when other attacks come out lightning fast. Takes some of the fun out of it and forces you to intimately learn the bosses moveset. This is most definitely the intention of Fromsoft but it increases frustration in many encounters.

Platforming is required in some sections of this game and the control you have over your movements feels VERY insufficient. It works great for large running and jumping actions but the minute control required to do parkour between floating platforms and thin wooden beams is not something this game does even close to good enough.

Intense Voice Acting
Spectacular Vistas
Satisfying rhythmic combat

Sinceramente, o game é entupido de bugs e totalmente mal otimizado, os graficos não são incríveis mas mesmo uma 3090 tem dificuldade para rodar, rodei tranquilamente Horizon Zero Dawn no Ultra que é 10x mais  lindo que Elden Ring e um mundo muito mais preenchido e não tive dificuldades pra manter 60fps, enquanto alguns inimigos nesse jogo fazem o FPS dropar para 25fps.

Gameplay, os inimigos combam infinitamente, leem os comandos que você da no teclado e como se isso não fosse suficiente, eles podem segurar os ataques e iniciar animações e imediatamente cancelar para outras, então boa sorte indo lá dar um golpe no boss enquanto ele ta na animação de recuperar, porque ele pode simplesmente cancelar e iniciar uma sequencia, na qual você não consegue esquivar porque esta preso no ultimo comando que você deu e quando levantar vai levar outro hit porque o jogo vai tentar executar o ultimo ataque por conta do input buffering ridiculo que esse jogo tem e nem preciso dizer da esquiva, qualquer um que joga Elden Ring sabe que leva 2s pra sair a esquiva depois de apertar o space.

Fora que não da pra trocar os inputs do game, cansei de morrer porque dei um ataque pesado que usa o (botao direito e esquerdo junto com o shift) e logo dps do ataque pesado saiu um ataque rapido por conta do input buffering gigantesco.

Os bugs daria pra fazer uma lista gigantesca, serio, NPC que some, NPC que revive, NPC q fica do mal sem motivos, quest que buga se vc der TP, itens que ficam inacessiveis se vc não seguir uma sequencia perfeita, tipo o slot de amuleto q se matar o boss dps de ter 3 slots o NPC n te entrega o slot porque ele só entrega se for menor que 2(incrível programação)

Balanceamento

Bosses com HP enorme, como pode o Margit ter 20k de HP, se você não grindar antes de ir para a luta, vai ficar 2h só pra matar o boss, fui tirando +650 por hit e levou 25(+  ou -)golpes pra finalizar o inimigo.

Dano, qualquer inimigo é praticamente one shot, serio, usar armadura e não usar armadura é praticamente a mesma coisa, 70%  de absorção de dano, ainda tomo 80% de dano pro Crucible Knight, jogo é feito pra vc nunca levar um golpe mas esqueceram de te falar que leva 2s dps de apertar space para a esquiva sair.

Design dos bosses é horrível, muitos só são bosses repetidos ou lutas onde eles colocaram 2 bosses mas não programaram pra eles lutarem com sinergia, eles simplesmente fica indo um em cima do outro spamando ataques sem parar, serio, Dupla do Godskins, só sabe ficar spamando o feitiço um após o outro sem nenhuma brecha pra atacar e não da pra trocar hit porque são 2.

De fato é pior souls da franquia, só recomendo jogar com Seamless Co-op, torna a experiencia menos frustrante e mais divertida, já que até o multiplayer original do game é um terrível.

The combat while difficult is rewarding and engaging. Even the simplest enemies can harm you if you don't respect them, and even the biggest and most epic monsters can be beaten if you're patient and learn their moves.
The world of Elden Ring is simply stunning, all of the zones are packed with fascinating places, NPCs and monsters. The game indicates where to go not by using arrows or markers, but simply by being well designed. There's always somewhere to go, someone to talk to or someone to fight.

The boss fights are something else, everytime there's a cinematic leading to a major boss I'm getting shivers. They are [b] EPIC[/b].

,148431901,"This review is my opinion. Other opinions are valid.

This game is kinda mix of Witcher 3 and Horizon Zero Dawn in Graphics and Dark souls in gameplay. But gameplaywise in comparison to Witcher  3 or Horizon Zero Dawn  many things are bad, simply bad. 

Leveling and pacing. You can grind or cheat runes and it will make combat easier for casual player. In Witcher 3 or Horizon or Skyrim there was no need to grind to fight bosses or progress in story.

Map navigation = there is no minimap, if you buy or find a map no markers will be shown,  not even points of interest or sites of grace, which was the case in Witcher 3 or Horizon Zero Dawn.

Bosses and many regular Mobs Combat is too complicated for casual and normal player. Blocking with shield does not work properly - many mobs or bosses like banished knights either have attacks which instadeplete your stamina with 1-2 hits ( this with maxed out stamina ! ) or even if you succesfully block and do a counter-hit they do fast follow up attacks which interrupt your counter-hit and do heavy damage or kill you. Magic attacks cant be blocked at all with shield. Stealth attacks or after stance break are random - one millisecond pressing button too long or standing wrong does only normal attack - in Horizon or Skyrim stealth attacks always worked.

Upgrade system is pure grind = finding smithing stones is grind. Witcher 3 solved it much better with runes and schematics for witcher gear and breaking down loot to resources.

NO bestiary diary = in a game with hard  dark souls combat not to include a bestiary like in Witcher 3 or Horizon Zero Dawn where weakness of enemies was shown what time of damage etc. and also some lore is awful. 

Fazit : Buy only if you are a Dark Souls fan, if you are a Witcher 3, Skyrim or Horizon Zero Dawn fan dont buy.

,148513339,"Elden Ring is a game I genuinely enjoyed. It's not often that I find myself completing a game, let alone achieving 100% completion, but Elden Ring drew me in quickly. I didn't even start playing it until about a week after its launch when someone told me what it was. I decided to get a hold of it after watching my friends mess around with Comet Azur and the Sword of Night and Flame. It's no surprise that it earned the Game of the Year title. This game is a rarity, one of those experiences that justifies both the launch price and the time invested.

The world they've crafted is expansive and filled with secrets and challenges that kept me engaged throughout my three playthroughs, each with different builds. The combat is satisfying, and, of course, it can be frustrating at times, but that was part of the appeal for me. I actually appreciated the fact that this wasn't a game I could grind for 10+ hours in one sitting. It made me appropriately frustrated, forcing me to return with a clear mind or after a good night's rest (especially when dealing with those dragon bosses everyone but me seemed to think were easy). If you're in the market for one of the best video games, give Elden Ring a go. It's a game I truly enjoyed and if you choose to wait for a sale that's okay too. A DLC should be dropping for it soon enough so that's something we can all look forward to.

Your own sequential attacks are largely theoretical since you're so fat you'll never get the second one off without being punished for being greedy. Of course there's no animation cancelling, so you can't even bail on your own 3 second wind-up to go back to tumbling like the world's okayest gymnast.

The world is empty and boring.

This game I find was not nearly as challenging as dark souls or Sekiro. Elden Ring feels like the end of souls games (from fromsoftwere), it feels like they have taken all they have learnt and fused it into one last souls game. and then added more on-top of it all.

 just try this game, if you like it, then I recommend trying Dark souls 1&3 (skip 2) & try Sekiro. if you try this game and don't like it, I absolute don't blame you, no game is for everyone. 
critics I can think of are mid duo fights (at least compare to dark souls) & repeated bosses also I will update this review when the DLC comes and i play it

My rating: 10/10
the game will be a legend for decades, and it's really addictive
every each a boss has a audio theme that u will not forgot the boss
even u just want to explore the map, u will ask yourself ""when can i complete all the sites?"". many times, soo many times
the community and tips in game really useful, it would really helpful for you so u wouldn't get any surprises from soldier/boss

i've never addicted to this game before, even my girlfriend mad to me because i abandoned her lol
i think, every person can't love this game, but every person should give a try on this game.
come join, tarnished, and became elden lord!",True
,148155773,"Pros:  World layout is great and nice to explore.  Great graphics and best animations.  Diverse enemy behaviors and attacks.  Mounted combat is ok.  Good amount of content.

Major cons:
Terrible PC port
Interface is made for console with no/very poor adaptation.
Can't remap all hotkeys.  Can't use all keys as an hotkey.
Menus and inventories are inconsistent.  Sometimes you are forced to use Esc to exit, sometimes another key, sometimes you can click, sometimes you can't.
Map navigation does not recognize remapped keys.  The entire map interface is terribad.  Can't even click on a desired destination but have to slowly scroll a cursor up to there.  w.t.f.?
Some menus forces you to use X and Z to navigate for example.   You can't even click instead sometimes.
Everything related to the quick pouch is terrible also.  Quickaccess are placed in a cross pattern for controller but does not indicate which hotkey is which.  No effort whatsoever in keyboard adaptation.
Can't drag anything: for example view angle in character creation, map view, moving content of inventory to storage or equipment pieces, etc.

The game is just made artificially difficult by imprecise mechanics:
Movement and attacks are imprecise and excessively clumsy to a point it is unfun.
The UI lacks audio feedback (for example to know if an action has been queued, or if stamina is lacking, etc.)
Forced to rely on a disappointing and inconsistent locked target auto-targeting attack system instead of properly aiming attacks and blocks.  It also locks the camera.  It is bad in every combination of settings options.  Minimal movement of the mouse can change the target to some irrelevant animal in the vicinity.
Locked target auto-aiming spells or projectiles make combat so boring.
Several deaths are caused by camera derping around near a wall, close to a large boss or inside a tent.
Some boss enemies attack cues are intentionally misleading.  This could be fine but only when progressed further in the game.  It is just forcing the players to tediously waste an excessive amount of time to learn bosses abilities or to use guides from outside the game.  If you used such a guide to learn how to beat a boss then that is a proof of this flawed design.  At first glance, those guides and videos seem to be numerous.
The core combat gameplay is mostly: learn the various boss choreographies, then patiently wait for your turn to poke in a few attacks, repeat.

Poor balance and design choices:
Your first battle is against an enemy you aren't meant to beat which is totally pointless and confusing.
The tutorial doesn't do a good job at letting you learn and experiment because those enemies are super slow, weak and die in one or two hits.
Many abilities seem pointless because under-tuned while some other seem too strong.  Therefore, the numerous attack options are reduced to only a couple useful ones.
Normal enemies are almost blind, you can kill one member of a patrol squad without a reaction from the rest. 
Most normal enemies will also give up chasing after 30 meters.

General annoyances:
Multiplayer messages are typically just spoilers and annoyance as players intentionally put them in the way to interfere with items to pickup or to activate.
It sucks that rolling and sprinting are forced to be on the same key.
Some random software crashes where you can lose progress and then, the game annoys you even more by giving you the ""You should quit the game properly"" message.
Resources gathering and crafting feel mostly pointless partly because the beneficial effect duration of consumables are very short.
Dark ambiance is well achieved although story is vague and confused.

I very much enjoy difficult games when the controls and camera are good but unfortunately, it is not the case here.  For better combat try out any of those: New World, Valheim, Tera, Black Desert Online, Skyrim or pretty much any aimed combat game designed for computer.

There is still some fun to be had.  However, I can not recommend this product until they replace the fake keyboard + mouse interface by a real one.

,148512677,"The game is still riddled with exploits and glitches that ruin PVP.  It's very clear that the developers do not play or care for their own game, or it's player base. I have received bans with no warning or explanation. I had just waited out a 180 day ban and had started playing the game again, and after a few weeks of on and off playing I find that I am once again banned for 180 days with no warnings or explanation given. Bandai Namco will never give you the exact reason for a ban and they will never accept an appeal. I have been told to just wipe my game of all of it's save data and wait for 180 days and hope that I can play again some day. If you wanna get into the souls type series of games I highly recommend not picking up Elden ring. Start with the older souls games, they have better game design, and back then they liked making the games and it shows. They have a more active online player base as well. Elden ring's online activity plays like a game that is 10 years old. You can spend 20-30+ mins trying to get invasions etc.  Elden ring could have been one of the greatest games ever and it sucks to see the state it's in due to incompetent / uncaring leadership.

,30157334,"If you're looking for a game review you've come to the wrong place. But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients
- To Make the Dough
375 grams (3 cups) plain flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil
1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water
Extra flour for dusting 


- To Make Cheese Filling
15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese
5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) ""3 Cheese Italian Blend"" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)
Note: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.
1/2 cup cheddar cheese
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper


- Extras
Your favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)
Parmesan cheese
Basil
Fried vegetables
Shrimp
Fish slices
Chicken pieces 
Make the Ravioli filling.

- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.
- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.
- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.
- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. 

Make the Ravioli dough.

- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.
- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.
- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.
- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.
- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.
- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).
- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. 

Fill the Ravioli shells.

- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.
- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.
- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.
- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.
- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. 

Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.

- Roll the dough into two sheets
- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.
- Fill with the ravioli mixture.
- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.
- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.

Cook the Ravioli.

- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.
- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.
- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest 
- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates

Serve it up.

,30152673,"Dota 2 is hard, but there's a huge reward for those who commit. On the surface, the game is a like-for-like reproduction of the genre-creating (and still updated) Defense of the Ancients modification for Warcraft III, now transferred into Valve's Source engine. The game's punishing design is sometimes enough to drive you up the wall, but it's worth sticking the hours in: success in Dota 2 is about learning to effectively juggle both the broad strokes and finer details.

If you're not aware of the basics of the burgeoning MOBA genre, two teams of five players spawn on corners of a map. Each team needs to work together with the goal of ultimately destroying a central structure--in Dota 2's case, the Ancient--in the opposing team's base. With most games lasting around the 40-minute mark, and occasionally edging past an hour, watching the enemy fortress dramatically crumble and sink to the ground feels like an exhilarating payoff.

Aiding these two teams, named the Radiant and the Dire, are waves of AI assistants, called creeps. Batches of creeps spawn at 30-second intervals and charge merrily up the map's three pathways. In the clumps of remaining land lies a jungle, where numerous AI opponents spawn, offering lucrative benefits to players who take them on successfully. Finally, and in a bid to stop both teams from simply marching into one another's base, each team gets three powerful towers on each lane that easily shred through enemy players at the start of the game.

Your individual ability to control and affect the rhythm of the game comes from how well you handle your hero. You mostly control a single unit in Dota 2, though there are exceptions: some heroes can summon controllable allies, such as bears, gargoyle babies, or wolves; one exceptionally versatile hero can split into three; and one item lets you take control of certain creeps. For each rule in Dota 2's impressive house-of-cards design, there's usually at least one character who completely ignores it, or finds a way around it via one of 130-odd items available from the in-match shop. For instance, try negating magic attacks with the black king bar, returning damage with the blade mail, or pounding out two ultimate abilities in quick succession with a refresher orb.

The aim for most players is to accumulate as much gold and experience as possible, with income being delivered mostly by scoring the killing blow on enemy creeps and players. It's almost always easier to gang up on stray enemies as a group, which is why it's rarely a good idea to run about on your own. Then it's a case of splashing all your hard-earned money on some ultra-powerful items from the shop, while levelling up your base stats and abilities, and then clobbering the enemy team into submission via a few five-versus-five team fights. Rarely does it feel that simple, however.

At the time of writing, 102 of the original Dota's 112 heroes have made their way into the sequel. Each hero has a handful of unique abilities and generally works best in a specific role, such as supporting other players as Omniknight, roaming around the map looking for opportunistic kills as Spirit Breaker, or evolving throughout the course of the game into an all-powerful vehicle of carnage and destruction as Phantom Assassin.

There's only one map, unlike in many other MOBA titles, although Valve has not ruled out the addition of more over time, and has previously offered game-changing modes with seasonal events at Halloween and Christmas. But Dota 2's single sprawling map sets itself apart from the competition by being larger, more intricate, and packed with greater detail than the rest of the genre. Unlike in League of Legends, the jungle area is riddled with far more tangling pathways, the lanes feature additional shops selling exclusive items, and savvy players are given more opportunities to use the environment to hide, flee, and ambush their opponents.

Often the game's dizzying scale is seen as off-putting or simply too complex, but the truth of Dota is that it can be entertaining as a new player to just sit down and let all those extraneous factors play out around you. Getting down to the brass tacks of the game with a group of like-minded friends is a lot of fun: start by buying your characters' recommended items, try your best not to get caught out of position, and get into the habit of buying observer wards. And watch out for Riki.

As you'd expect from Valve, this is a beautifully presented game, with the Half-Life and Portal maker running victory laps around its competition in terms of UI, voice acting, and showing how to deftly add real personality to its characters. Only recently has the developer turned its attention to gently easing new players into the proceedings, however, and even now, mastering the basics feels like learning to swim by jumping in at the deep end. Efforts are being made to remedy this, though: right now there are a couple of tutorial levels, some well-designed AI bots, and a newbie playlist that restricts hero selection to just 20 of the most frequently picked characters. And with community-created hero guides now built directly into the game itself, Dota 2 is much easier to get started with than it has been in the past.

Play a match every evening for a couple of weeks, and you start to see how Dota 2's wealth of disparate systems and mechanics combine into their own harmony, and you begin to understand how there are hundreds of elements that affect the game. Dota 2 is a tense war of accumulation and attrition. The biggest problem, which is coincidentally where the real excitement of the game lies, comes from struggling to process and interpret dozens upon dozens of mitigating circumstances while simultaneously trying to keep your cool.

It is a complicated and exhausting game, and for the first few weeks, it's challenging just keeping up with the general rhythm of a match. But invest enough time into Dota 2, and you develop an almost unconscious ability to keep up with the game--performing actions such as sending the slightly fiddly in-game courier over to the faraway ""secret"" shop to get some rare items, for instance. After a couple of hundred hours of Dota 2, what once felt like spinning plates just happens automatically.

While Dota 2 has transferred the core of the original Dota into a cleaner, modern engine, the fact remains that losing is uniquely painful. Death in Dota 2 not only gives your opponent money, but robs you of some of your own and leaves you waiting up to a minute to respawn. By the time you've trudged back across the game's massive map--or spent money on a teleportation scroll--your opponent is now stronger and richer. Die two or three times in quick succession, which is easily done, and a match of Dota becomes a painful experience where you spend the next half hour getting bullied by an increasingly superior enemy. Other games in the genre have tried to mitigate this punishment, but Dota 2 positively revels in its complexities. The rich just get richer.

The original Dota was an unexpectedly powerful blend of clashing genres and disparate elements that ended up taking over the world, and Valve's successor retains the original rules and characters while adding in a cheery free-to-play model and slick production values. The experience of playing Dota changes day by day--some evenings will be exhilarating, while others will kick your morale to the curb--but there are few games as worthy of your time investment as this. Those who choose to commit to Dota 2 will find many happy hours within this immaculate update.

I don't like Patch 4.0 however. The graphical updates make the game stupid slow and I'm forced to play the game in 1080p on a system that runs other modern games at 4k high settings. In addition many of the balancing changes were unnecessary in a single player game. I wanted to finish a playthrough where I was in Toussaint and my build (5 decoction euphoria) is completely botched. Granted alchemy was overpowered, but nerfing acquired tolerance + heightened tolerance + manticore armor seems like overkill, and I can only drink three decoctions without having to spam stamina for ekhidna HP regen to offset losing health. In addition a bunch of my decoctions are gone from the inventory.

Probably I will have to just drink a potion of clearance and reset everything. But I don't know the extent of all the balance changes and feel like I have to relearn everything, which feels like a big chore on a game this old.

[*][b]A metric ton of exposition[/b] - I mean good god the dialogues in this game are longer than the lifespan of a turtle - and there's a fuckin' billion of them. Be prepared to watch dozens of hours of cutscenes.
[*]Take no damage dropping 2 feet, yet die at full health from falling 3 feet - I recommend a fall damage mod to make this a non-issue.

You will laugh, cry, think, and feel in this masterpiece of fantasy RPG.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a game that you must play if you love RPGs or fantasy games. It is a game that will make you forget about everything else. It is a game that will stay with you forever.

Edit - This was a positive recommendation (it's a great game, no doubt) except...

CDPR, why? For whatever reason when I try playing the non ray traced version (classic version), it just refuses to open. Plus they've also included their Red Launcher with installing this game. I've spent a couple hours trying to look up and troubleshoot this issue online but can't seem to find anything on how to fix it. 

Ironically though, the Ray Traced version works fine, but is quite demanding. The classic version worked perfectly a couple years ago when I played the first time.

I mean get this game if you have a beefy system that can handle the new update, but if you're hoping to play with the old graphics, beware. Might not work for you.

Edit x2 - So I managed to finally get it to work. I needed to install Visual C++ 2012 64 bit for a missing DLL (I never got the error for the missing DLL by launching the game through Steam, but found the witcher.exe file in Witcher3>bin>x64>witcher.exe. Opening that gave me the dll error and I finally figured out the issue).
Not sure why Visual C++ wasn't auto installed with the game (they generally are), but at least the game works now.


The launcher is still garbage >:(",True

A silver-tongued devil
His army of elves
At his hooves did they revel
They came after me
With masterful deceit
Broke down my lute
And they kicked in my teeth
While the devil's horns
Minced our tender meat
And so cried the Witcher
He can't be bleat
Toss a coin to your Witcher
Oh, Valley of Plenty
Oh, Valley of Plenty, oh
Toss a coin to your Witcher
Oh, Valley of Plenty
At the edge of the world
Fight the mighty horde
That bashes and breaks you
And brings you to mourn
He thrust every elf
Far back on the shelf
High up on the mountain
From whence it came
He wiped out your pest
Got kicked in his chest
He's a friend of humanity
So give him the rest
That's my epic tale
Our champion prevailed
Defeated the villain
Now pour him some ale
Toss a coin to your Witcher

Toss a coin to your Witcher

I don't think I can say anything that hasn't already been said. This is a masterpiece, and I don't throw this word around lightly. This is far and above my favorite western RPG and it is not even close. The amount of detail that was put into the world, with all the side quests that are as interesting, and in some cases more, than the main story, along with tons of NPC dialogue as you pass by, really make the world feel alive.
It is also rare that a western RPG has a memorable soundtrack, but this game has done it, the music is fantastic, with some stand outs in particular. 
Gameplay is good, although a bit on the easy side, but the difficulty settings exist to tune your own experience, for people who want a decent challenge, I recommend the difficulty below the highest, it struck a nice balance of difficulty without becoming annoying, and actually made me interact with the games' various systems such as the potions, crafting etc.

I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.

,146105915,"The game has not aged well. If Elden Ring was your first From Software game and you want to see 'where it all began', I would recommend playing it. But only then. 

This is my first ever review, but since everyone seems to criticize the remastered version for being an overpriced patch and I just wanted to know if the game is a good choice for newcomers, I wanted to share my toughts on the game as someone who has no nostalgia connected to it. 

I have never played a Dark Souls game before (Elden Ring was my introduction) and never thought I ever will (too hard, too frustrating), but since Elden Ring is my favourite gaming experience since The Witcher 3 and Red Dead Redemption 2, I thought I finally had to give it a try (discount...). And although Elden Ring pulled my in right from the start, Dark Souls 1 never really reached me. The mechanics, erratic questlines, weird npcs and the interconnected world - it is all there, but (for me) Elden Ring is just the way superior experience. In every aspect.

Even though I - of course - did not expect it to be as good as ER, I still was disappointed. I don't really know why I never really enjoyed the game, but one reason is that there is almost never any music, which in ER greatly enhanced the atmosphere for me. In Dark Souls 1 the only things you hear are your own too loud footsteps and the monsters/fight sounds. That can be immersive in tight dark corridors - but it never was for me. The parts I liked the most were the very first area (dark clouds, a fallen castle, thunder rumbling in the background: excellent), and the very last area (mostly because of the visuals). Here the game really shines.

Speaking of visuals: usually, I do not care much about graphics, especially if it is a game from 2011, but I have to say, except from the lighting in some areas: this game does not look good, especially the late game areas reminded me of Gothic 1, a (great) game from 2001, that was already graphically outdated when it was released. In DS1 many areas are pretty big, but also feel pretty empty. I don't want to spoil anything, but often they are just bland: too huge (but of course smaller than in ER) to really fill them, so you have some items and some enemies here and there and that's it. I never was fully intrigued by this world and was never motivated to think about the story of this decaying land as I was in Elden Ring, where every part of the world seems to breathe story and atmosphere. The same thing is said about Dark Souls 1, but at least I did not have this impression.

My biggest concern before playing was the difficulty. After playing Elden Ring (and Sekiro) the game is pretty manageable. The bosses almost move in slow-mo compared to the two and should not give you too much trouble, if you have played ER or Sekiro. But even here, the game could not convince me. While ER felt like a fair and rewarding challenge, the gameplay in DS1 often just annoyed me due to just annoying design choices. In one notorious area for example 1 hit (arrow) of a certain enemy type is enough to change your status into toxic - at the beginning of the area. Have fun to explore and fight! The said enemies don't respawn and you can use an item against it (if you know about it), but it is still a cheap way to artificially increase a difficulty that is not challenging but often simply annoying. Another example: you can get a curse that halves your HP, even after you died - good luck finding a cure. Not to speak of one of the most annoying boss fights in video game history. Many will say that this is the typical Dark Souls experience and it certainly is. But ER never annoyed me this way, while still being an actual challenge (learn movesets) and providing a breathing and mysterious world.
 
Just a newcomers perspective. I only finished it once and I do not know if I will ever play it again. So why still the thumbs up? Because I absolutely love Elden Ring and can acknowledge its promising beginning in DS1.

That being said, a lot of the quality of life improvements are still missing here, which is a good thing. The world feels much more condensed, raw and deadly. The atmosphere is phenomenal and clearly sets this game apart from ER.

I got it on a deal for roughly 20 bucks, but if I wasn't on a tighter budget right now would have bought it at it's regular 40 bucks as well at some point.

I think there's no need to argue the quality of this game anymore. Graphically it works just fine setting a very distinctive tone. Sound design and music is top notch.

All in all I highly recommend Dark Souls to anyone seeking a good challenge and to players familiar with newer FromSoft titles who can live without some of the quality of life things like fast travel and an in-game map system.",True

The PvE is pretty much the same, hitboxes of certain attacks from certain bosses are a little more forgiving (Smough's ass slam, Ceaseless Discharge tenticle slams and swipes, Stray Demon AOE blast, etc.) due to the game now running natively at 60fps, so that is nice. The lighting is worse than in the original, a lot of the metallic armors look like they're made out of plastic now.

I don't care what anyone says. This is not a good game.

A terrible game. Ugly graphics, clunky controls. But the worst thing about the game is it doesn't respect the player's time. 
Why is the distance between bonfire and the boss fight more than 1 full minute?
Why is there no fast travel between bonfires?
Why are there so few bonfires?
Why is there no guide or help of any kind?
Why should I go to youtube to find out whatever the hell is going on?

I like hard games, but this is f-ing ridiculous. It's all about wasting players time. If I was immortal and had all the time in the world, sure, I'd keep playing without complaining, but who has the f-ing time to go back and forth with no point.

I recommend the brilliantly implemented Remnant: From the Ashes to anyone instead of this garbage.

So far 50/100

I call it a day. I have this bad habit of playing even a bad game to its end, but I've just had it with this one.
The problem is not that it is hard or the boss fights. The problem is the time it takes to get to the f-cking boss. I spent nearly a 10th of the game going from bonfire to the boss fight location, and it frustrating as f-ck.
Why the f-uk should I play half the game to get the ability to jump between bonfires?
And then I had to go thru the sh-t maps like blighttown, lava town and crystal town, when I watched the walk through for the great hollow map, I said I am done. Enough is enough.

The gamers and critics who review should be more responsible. Instead of calling what it it - frustrating - they called it hard and it achieved a cult status, which is ridiculous.

An iconic name, rhyming with difficulty and despair. 
It is true to an extent. 
I wanted to try it for myself, even if I'm not a hardcore gamer. And what a journey ! 

I finished it in Normal Game and in New Game +. 


The art is one of the points that surprised me the most. The remastered version is beautiful and smooth, the dark fantasy, bleak but nonetheless medieval fantastic atmosphere is something that I missed in games. Just look at landscapes from Sen's Fortress and Anor Londo, and you will feel a real medieval Lord of the Ring's Weathertop, Osgiliath and Minas Tirith or Berserk castles vibes. I also really loved the forest/ruins environment from Undead parish. 

The music is non existent while exploring, it gives a real feeling of vulnerability since you are startled by the smallest environmental noise. It is also epic and terrifying while fighting bosses. My favourites ones are those from Ornstein & Smough and Kalameet. 

The scenario and lore are quite difficult to find, you have to look up the item's descriptions to gather informations. Even if it is rewarding to understand the puzzle bit by bit, I was often lost with the lore and I don't think I could understand it without videos and wikis. Also the NPCs dying or going hollow if you didn't talked to them at a specific point or didn't do something to keep them alive (even if you didn't know) is a tad frustrating. 

As Sartre said ""Hell is other people"". Well, in Dark Souls you'll start to think it's true. Especially when you try to return to the bonfire with enough souls to level up and a bloke invade you while you have no more estus, let you get rammed by monsters and emote on your face after backstabbing you... Unforgettable experience.

The difficulty is one of the most iconic part. The fact that you can't choose the difficulty is THE BEST. It is something that you never experienced before. At first I took three weeks to reach O&S because I was scared to die. But after beating NG, I got like ""f*ck it we ball"" and played normally. Dark Souls is one of the best gaming experience I had with Nier: Automata. The feeling when you triumph from an area that gave you nightmares is unique (I'm looking at you Tomb of Giants, you were the first area to make me ragequit in 20 years of gaming). Or after beating monstrous boss (Ornstein and Smough of course, but also Artorias, Manus, or Four Kings in NG+... They nearly crushed my spirit). You'll have to keep your mental resilience in check and never yield. My advice is to take small breaks (5 minutes to a few hours) when you begin to get tilted, and come back with a renewed spirit.

,114207792,"Best Souls game by a mile. It's janky as hell, literally looks like PS2 era graphics, has terrible, literally atrocious, hitboxes, and often feels downright unfair, not to mention the ridiculous commitment to actions, absurdly slow healing, and weird hit directionalization. Cannot put this game down. In all seriousness tho, yes, I do think this is the best souls game, purely for the highs and lows this game makes you feel. You will feel some of the most intesne rage at trying to complete areas or fighting bosses, or fighting the run up to bosses, and it will make you grind your teeth to ash with rage. Then, you will experience an orgasmic, near divine feeling of joy and satisfaction upon completing those areas or killing those bosses. But what really makes this game peak souls is the vibes. No other souls games makes you feel so bleak, so downtrodden, so helpless as this game does. The gameplay reinforces the themes and emotions of the game: you feel frustrated and angry at the controls because you feel helpless, much like your character is supposed to feel helpless in the face of the inevitable fading of fire and the futility of the choice they are given in the end. This game, for all its jank and issues, is a masterpiece",True

,113779673,"Dark Souls II is a game that is very controversial among the community. A video Ill be referencing is ""In The Defense of Dark Souls II"" by Hbomberguy. I figured I'd agree with him. I watched his video while playing Dark Souls I. I heavily disagree however and its funny because the reasons he defends it I agree with. The problem is all the major issues he COMPLETELY IGNORED. (love you hbomberguy lol)

Movement - An important core part of DARK SOULS. It defines your life and death... and this games movement is horrible. I found as I moved around something didnt feel right, I would turn and snap into a certain direction. On top of this while moving, my character seemingly wanted to move towards the direction the camera was facing. I came to find the there are only 8 directions of movement. As if this is a 2D old school top down game. This is horrible. This is pivotal to parkour and fighting, and it has caused me to die CONSTANTLY. IT S DOWN RIGHT HORRIBLE. Moving across tight platforms even had me zig zagging across them with a side ways camera angle running away from enemies in a tight position because of the 90 degree snap Id do left and right.  90% of my deaths have not been because of lack of skill or anything but falling to my death, or not moving properly in battle because the game isn't designed to well at all. This is down right, unacceptable and ruins a core aspect of the game.  I'm not even done yet though.

GENERAL COMBAT - The AI in this game is incredibly dumb. If there's a bump on the ground they cant get to you, if you aren't on the same ground level of them they don't know you are there even if you are in front of them. They also kill themselves accidentally allll the time. other games are known to use this as a strategy, but its blatant and a massive problem in DARK SOULS II. Also, combat in this game is as slow as molasses. Its personally very much so not my thing, and its quite bad. Especially when things like parries are heavily delayed. It feels right in the other games but very not so here, just feels weird. Also, side note, your weapons brake insanely quickly now... It just makes you sit at a bonfire, and stops the flow of the game. Which I loved because at least this game had teleportation unlike DS1. This game loves snaps, because lock ons can provide ridiculous snap on attacks, with a side of enemies also doing so. There is a hammer enemy that you can dance around all day and dodge spam if you wanna, but he will like spin snap to you and squash you, this rarely happens when you lock on to enemies too. Its clear why this is a problem for locking on, but maybe not so much to everyone fighting an enemy. You could argue once you know itll be ok, or that you just get used to it but it just feels dumb and unnatural. It also makes it hard to time when they are acting like you are still in that direction and then suddenly in a milisecond snap to you. Locking on can also be horrible in general because you can dodge and when you attack instead of hitting the lock on it will attack in the direction you rolled, how terrible is that!?!  again dark souls 2... UNACCEPTABLE!
(Also, backstabs like never register for some reason... When they do, they require two taps now because its a back wack and then an attack, 50% of the time on top of the already hard to activate move thats super precise, it will fail and the second hit wont register while you are either A hit, or B the enemy just rolls away somehow...)

HITBOXES - This game has perfect hitboxes sometimes, and othertimes... THEY ARE SHIT, and inaccurate. You will be hit when you shouldn't be. Its important that the game presents to you when, or how you will be hit, and this does not do that well sometimes at all. This can be frustrating and dumb. ADP will fix it though! Then YOUR HITBOXES someitmes dont hit when they should, in a game where mistakes can mean death, this is unacceptable. Sometimes I got hit by enemies that Id kill and they wouldn't get to swing and the swing that doesn't exist would HIT ME AND KILL ME!! alternatively, sometimes the enemies should be hitting me but swords go through me like I'm a ghost. Other times explosions would kill me through walls, other times arrows would kill me through walls. These bastards are just using no-clip now! THIS IS CONSISTENT. You probably think its just a few moments of video game unfairness, but unlike other games, this game is consistent and common with it... UNACCEPTABLE. 

ADP - You have got to be kidding me. If I didn't look this up I would have had an even worse time in this game. This alone is unacceptable. This stat, seems on the surface to just increase agility and resistance to poisons and etc... BUT ITS NOT JUST THAT ITS ALSO I FRAMES!!! aka invincibility frames in your roll! This is explained or shown NOWHERE. This is important, most players will run through this game unable to dodge for shit, itll probably make them fall back to using a shield and you know why? BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO ALMOST FRAME PERFECT ROLL BECUASE THEY DONT KNOW TO UP ADP!!! This is also just insane absolutely insane! MAKE SURE YOU DO THAT BTW! ADP! ADP! ADP!!!! (which gets OP when you can TRIPLE that amount, this can be INSANELY OP!) ((ITS ALSO BAD IN TERMS OF RPG CHOICE MAKING!!!))

HEALTH DEPLETION - After every death, even over dumb parkour issues you will be having because of movement problems (and combat scenarios like all the time.) you will be punished severely. This is a game where you are expected to die a lot. This game doesnt make you think: ""ooh ooh I should make sure I dont die and try harder!"" It makes you not be as open and free to testing things out and be aggressive. On top of this, this game that expects you to die shouldnt punish you by dying, especially that half a health bar can mean EVERYTHING when this is a game where you can die in 1-3 hits. Very dumb mechanic. Its like its just hard for the sake of being hard, absolutely terrible.

LEVEL DESIGN - Some areas are poorly designed and lack depth, a lot of areas of the game are also just OP status effect screwing you over. It makes playing this game a chore sometimes, and makes you not want to replay it, some areas are just annoying.

BOSSES - So easy, and most of them are reskins, or super forgetable. Its really bad. I beat most of them first try. Some of them suffer the AI syndrome of sucking as well, not being smart and also easily able to circle around. Seriously, kinda made me wish they were doing the bullshit snap on. (They could learn how to make them use wide sweeping attacks like bosses do to react in the other games but ig screw that!)

Now for some more minor problems:

Soul accumilation - You gain wayy too many souls in this this game. You level up wayy too much. Its pretty bad. This ruins the balance. The other souls games makes sure you dont tackle everything and punishes you for it, as you should go down a certain build and plan. On the other hand its cool that you can explore many areas and even embarassingly maybe all areas in this game, but you just get so op...

FINAL OVERVIEW: Dark Souls II is a disaster with really good moments... Its something you wish was good but is not... Its rotten to its core in problems, that could be fixed and it'd be much better of a game. Its not a horrible and bad game though, its just decent at MOST. These problems are massive, but when they aren't happening, this is a decent game. Its the biggest of them all, I didn't complete it all though, just a fat chunk of it, I couldn't bring myself to finish it... The story is quite good too, but this is definitely the weakest in the series, with broken horrible problems in it.

7/10 - Dark Souls II is undeniably the worst in the series, a game that was just second hand during Bloodbornes development. The best all went over to work on it. This left B team working on DS2. (P.S. NEVER GET SCHOLAR OF THE FIRST SIN! ITS EVEN MORE BROKEN!)",False

The developers of this Entry to the Souls series should be ashamed of themselves. Enjoyed the feel of impact your weapon had in the first game? gone. Your good at dodging? well too bad now you have to dump unnecesarrily large amounts of levels into the dumbest new addition to the series, The adaptability stat, what a JOKE. Youll take damage in the middle of your rolls and every single boss needs to be fought PERFECTLY there is no room for mistakes, I fought about 8 bosses and nothing new opened up, Nothing special happened, I didnt receive any cool loot there is ZERO sense of progression at all and when you finally do unlock something new the devs just say ""Screw you!"" and throw huge swarms of enemies that can only be beat with the precision of jesus himself, there is zero fun to be had in this game, every corner I took i just wanted to rip my hair out!! I love the souls series, I have played and FINISHED games from the series, This one? hell no, i know garbage when i see it, and this is garbage, Everything in this game seems like a DIRECT DOWNGRADE from the game BEFORE this one, Sorcery and all form of magic have the laziest animations ive ever seen, it looks terrible! not fun to play at all and Melee is just the same, Re used animations for completely different weapons and what a joke ""powerstance"" is, It just puts the same moveset over what could be 30 different movesets, but no we only get about 4 with powerstance, even with a plethora of weapon combinations WHAT A JOKE!

Almost all of the bosses can boil down to dodge one or two times, get a couple hits in, and repeat until dead. No creativity with movesets, nothing to look out for ect. Fromsoft also now took the servers down with no news on them ever coming back again. The level design for the first 1/3 of the game is quite good but it becomes very tedious and unimaginative later in the game when they just shove a massive amount of annoying enemies before a boss room leaving you with a choice of failing most of the time to run past and get into the boss room without being killed, or to waste 10-15 minutes of your life killing every single one of them before you enter the boss room everytime.",False

I wouldn't recommend purchasing this except for on sale. The game is basically the same as DS2:SOFS (I can say the same in either direction - you only need one copy of the game if you're on a budget) with varied enemy placement. This version basically does not have the 'spambushes' of scholar, so the enemy placement is overall very different. It is mostly for the better. However, some areas seem just randomly stuffed with enemies without care whatsoever. Scholar also slightly improved hitboxes (it seems) as well as improving the damage on boss attacks (ancient dragon in this version is much worse than in scholar - my hardcap vigor character with good armor is getting one shot by every move).
Overall, it's a fun way to re-experience the game (if you started with scholar first).
A big issue I have with this version is the prevalence of one shots that enemies have: the ancient dragon and the mounted overseers are designed to one shot you no matter what. Even with god mode activated on a trainer, these two enemies do so much scripted damage that you are supposed to get one shot no matter your stats.",False

,113228737,"While I have enjoyed this game over the years, I can no longer recommend it. Fromsoft/Bandai have taken the multiplayer/co-op servers down since a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability was publicly exposed a month before elden ring's launch. The RCE issue has apparently been in all of the Dark Souls games on PC since Dark Souls PtDE, they were aware of it and did nothing about it until they were publicly shamed into fixing for their new cash cow, elden ring. Now the Dark Souls series is listed as single player, no longer as multiplayer/co-op (aside from the user tags, which aren't official). Since they don't appear to intend to fix the servers for their back catalog of souls games too, like they should have back in the days of Dark Souls PtDE, they don't deserve a positive review.",False
,113220049,"Even with all the sh*t it gets I've really grown to like Dark Souls 2 and this version is FAR superior than the Scholar of the First Sin edition (SotFS for short)
it might be a little on the easy side compared to other (official) SoulsBorne games but it doesn't  feel like they just randomly copy pasted some  enemies just to annoy you like with SotFS

If you want to play Dark Souls 2 do yourself a favour and get THIS version NOT SotFS

Also I played SotFS first and hated it and online I saw people with similar problems to mine and one guy then recommended  the original DS2 and let me just say I'm happy I gave the game a second chance because
OG-DS2 is my second favourite Dark Souls game (So not counting Bloodborne and Elden Ring) as of now and  I prefer it over DS3 (not DS1 though)",True
,113204583,"ds2 us a marvelous sequel to ds1. fromsoft rectified a lot of their previously made mistakes and added some very enjoyable new additions like powerstancing and life-gems but unfortunately fromsoftware struggles to create a difficult game without adding a shit ton of bullshit to annoy the player.

before I start naming the flaws this game has, I'll list the improvements the devs added like fixing the bad lock-on camera and overhauling the combat system to the point of which it feels genuinely smooth. 
build variety in this game, is excellent. 
power-stancing weapons is a great feature and trying to dissuade the player from turtling up behind a shield, is even better. 
the lore is fantastic and dragleic is an amazing place in regards to lore. 

that unfortunately is all I can praise this sequel for. 
there are too many issues in ds2 that makes it one of the worst sequels in the souls franchise. it's the most contentious topic amongst the community and with good reason. 

this game has no beautiful vistas like ds1, despite it being graphically superior. 

life-gems are great but unfortunately they completely replace estus flasks because of how slow the flask animation is

adaptability is the worst skill ever conceived in gaming. most who played through this game blind - like myself on the ps3 - would have claimed the hitboxes in this game are far worse than ds1 but it's not true. your i-frames are bound to this skill.
there is no rhyme or reason to this. maybe they wanted to make the game more difficult? or maybe they wanted to copy monster hunter even more by making it similar to evade-window? I honestly can't tell but I can safely say it's unnecessary and only serves to annoy the player.

then there is the fact that some enemies have infinite poise even if you smack them with dual colossal swords. again I don't understand why this is a thing or why the devs insisted on it but this further adds to the fact that most of these encounters become a red light/green light game that leaves the player with massive disadvantage. 

furthermore, the enemy- & npc-placement in this game is laughable. almost everything is a gank for no reason. why throw a bunch of exploding enemies next to an npc? why place a bonfire next to a group of enemies that will immediately aggro once you stand up? 

why add so many humanoid bosses that are so easy to fight? srsly the generic trash-mobs in this game are more challenging than the bosses. why throw 3 of those generic humanoid bosses in a boss arena? why are there so many gank bosses? 

because fromsoftware lacks the ability to create a good and challenging game but unfortunately even with their efforts focused on making the game more difficult, the entirety of the content is too easy. 
I have played through all souls games and up until bloodborne this franchise was nothing but an afterthought with incredibly good lore. ds1&2 are infuriating games because of how poorly both titles have been playtested. 

to wrap this up, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, because it fails to be competent sequel and instead of learning from their mistakes, the devs further add more infuriating things like adp and ganks to annoy the player. 
honestly if anyone is interested in a fair but difficult game, then try out nioh. team ninja is still king in regards to combat.",False
,113183869,"Despite what you may have heard this game is quite good even when compared to the original Dark Souls. It certainly never drops to the tragically low levels of quality that are found in Dark Souls final third, and is more consistent in quality throughout. My main gripes with the game would be the animations/attacks don't feel as impactful, with a decent amount of the reasoning for that being the sound effects I believe. A simple bandit axe would do comparable damage to a massive Greatsword, but would sound and look like you were hitting the enemy with a balloon. I'm also not a big fan of changes made for New Game+. Generally, remixed enemies could be a fun change, but the ones added in this game just serve to be incredibly annoying, especially considering a lot of them are player-like red phantoms that are extremely annoying and unfun to fight. 

Regardless, I still enjoyed the game quite a bit, and I think anyone who liked the first would like this one as well. Just be prepared to approach the combat in a different way, as a lot has changed due to the focus on multiple enemy encounters and the re-introduction of consumable healing items which are easily acquired. The battles are a lot more focused on the short term engagement rather than the long term of preserving your estus as you carefully pick through an area.",True

First of all they did not fulfill their promise.
Their trailer/ teaser showed a huge graphics overhaul and the lighting mechanism.

I don't care much for graphics, i think they are ok, what i do care about is false advertising. And showing graphics and then not living up to them is lying. Same goes for lighting. I was kind of excited for this but never had to use a torch. Another thing they didn't implement yet showed on their trailer.


What impression does this give me?

"" Let's build hype so the pre-order are super high.""
"" Rush this product, we need money and then we can already start with DLC.""


At any rate this is the least of my concerns with not recommending this game.

The pre-order bonus weapons are plain useless, why even include them? For me it would have been fine just having OST and that comic. But then again ==> impulsive buyers, younger crowd, etc..

Now the part that made me quit this game on completion.

There is barely any difficulty in this game, it is all replaced with artificial difficulty.
Most deaths occur to being stunlocked and combo'd to death, a vertical slash swiping horizontally to follow your roll. Hits that do not hit your character, yet take away health.

Rarely do you face loner enemies like the black knights in DS 1 for example. Which were worthy and dangerous adversaries. In DS 2 you will most of the time find yourself outnumbered. And for a bunch of depraved corpses they can move damn fast and have lots of stamina.

This also includes magic homing attacks, yes Amana it's about you..

The same goes for invasions etc. there's lag, which causes overall frustration especially if you are in a tough area where you finally managed to progress and some invader beats you down especially if he lags very hard or the hitdetection messes up, which it does quite frequently. The fact they put out the red eye orb infinite usage doesn't really stimulate much invasion, which i don't really mind but would make it a boring grind for me if i wanted to invade.

Then again there's quite the amount of cheaters in the game like in DS 1 that roam freely. Again From fails to do something about it.

The bosses are ok for the most part. The looking glass knight was refreshing though i dislike him summoning players in the game but  it's a nice touch. Most bosses though don't feel rewarding for killing. How many times i got sucked into a grapple animation while being slightly out of reach. The overall of bosses is not so satisfying and some are even copy pasted from DS 1 or mobs in DS 2.

Some bosses even get mob thrash in order to be difficult like Freya. It's to make the game difficult but i think it's not really adding anything to the challenge. It makes the artificial difficulty higher though.

Then NG + is supossed to be harder which it was but again tweaking artificial difficulty. Sinner gets some red ghost pyromancers to help, there's more red phantoms everywhere. In short ==> swarm tactics. Again upping artificial difficulty and not feeling so challenging but rather unfair.

I noticed differences in playing DS 1 and DS 2. In DS 2 i'm more relying on spamming health items and other stuff while in DS 1 i try to refrain from using healing items until the boss fight so i have the biggest chance of survival. Which could lead to this impression: die in DS 2, just buy more soulgems, herbs, rouge water whatevs. Outtank the problem.


Soul Memory is not popular, i don't really care that much but what i do find nasty about it is that if a hacker would invade you or you invade one that has 99999999 souls and he jumps off a cliff or so, you get a very high soul memory and you'll get invaded by people way bove your paygrade.



the story itself is not bad, it's ok, DS 1 had better story and atmosphere IMO.
Bonfires had much more weight and meaning in DS 1 as in you could not just teleport everywhere at the start of the game. It was used to level up, become human, kindle. there were fewer bonfires making them very precious.

in DS 2 some areas are riddled with them, you can teleport from start and they only replenish Estus and reset the mobs. Leveling up, you always have to go to the herald, listening to her ramblings over and over, same with estus shards. Everything has to be done with the herald. Which is not gamebreaking i just find it annoying. Bonfires always had weight in DS lore but now they don't get that much importance anymore.

I could be wrong since i rushed through this game with a walkthrough after having enough of this game. I just wanted to see the end story, but i haven't seen a single firekeeper in the game, and aren't bonfires supossed to douse when firekeepers are dead. Besides the 4 witches in things betwixt there aren't any keepers.


In short: i do not recommend this game at all. It's a step back from DS 1 maybe because of all the hype and attention over the years and Bandai cracking the whip, maybe greed, i don't care. The results count and for me, it's a mediocre game at best.


EDIT:

Bought the DLC too... all of them were exact the same shait as i mentioned above... an illustrious gangbang of opponents and behemoths spouting their hot magma jizz on you..

Not to mention the other attempt to make a BlightTown anal bleeding dungeon.. YES SUNKEN CROWN, YOU.

The dragon boss was the only good thing about this dlc.

Now the Iron crown or whatever.. the dlc with the tower of fire and ash.

It was MEH at best..  Fume knight was quite boring.


Finally Ivory Crown.. Interesting visuals, nice little snow effect on clothes. Interesting aspect of the female voice. ( I won't spoil it)

Final boss had a nice arena but the boss itself was rather a disapointment.. i found the sabre cat boss to be the most surprising but it relied on a cheap unavoidable first death. Screw you for exploring you daft minge... you should have taken the other direction. But that is ok.. it was surprising.

The rest of the enemies are just plain stupid.


Scolar of DLC is a cashgrab... whatever the hell you all say.. it adds NOTHING to the game...

Just some units need replacing a new NPC here and there, some items. done... oh and the direct X upgrade of course which you all craved while stroking the fallus of Bandai.

Cheap abyssmal business practice that raked in heaps of cash because the new era gamer is a spineless and gutless hyped up freakshow on a leash. 

Let us hope DS 3 will be better with the old leading dev behind it.

Here be dragons, invisible walls, traps, environmental puzzles, and a deeply rewarding adventure for those that love exploring.  Just like before, their are fragments of lore scattered about and story telling the revolves much more on design and ascetic than simply shouting at your face, ""this was a bad dude."" 

The only issue the game has is there is no online play. That means you won't see phantoms of other players running around the world, or soapstone signs with poorly translated hints, or encounter the true boss fights of the game, other players. Even so, as a solo adventure there is plenty to see and do, and if your like me and like finding things out yourself, will feel all the more rewarded for it. There are still NPC summons if a particular boss proves to difficult, and the branching paths of the game mean you can bounce between 2 or 3 areas at any given time to make progress when you feel you hit a wall in one.

,112062720,"DS2 has hitbox issues the likes of which no other souls game sees, and also has rolling upgrades and lifegems, nerfing estus. Also probably has the worst casting overall in the entire series.

What does it have that's good? The best hub location & music, some really pretty locations, No-Man's Wharf and Iron Keep, which I will not discuss in detail, and an insanely broken Lightning damage type that makes you feel powerful until you start playing the DLC's.

Overall? Fucked up game. You can tell the B-team made it. However, it's still fun, even if it wants to make you rip your hair out at times (and, realistically, every Souls game does). 

[i]Now, what about SotFS?[/i]

Never liked it. SotFS was described as a remaster that fixes a lot of the game's issues - and it really only fixes a handful. Tweaks some stats on spells and hexes, some weapons (insignificant at most), changed to run at 60fps natively, and changed item locations (like Branch of Yore being available from the Hag at Cardinal Tower early on). What it also changed was enemy locations.

Heide's Tower goes from easily being a SL1 area to complete enemy spam. No-Man's Wharf is worse. Iron Keep makes you hate yourself. Shaded Woods is also complete enemy spam, on top of already being a poison level. And these changes seem to be bipolar at best, because it seems incredibly backwards-thinking; certain parts in locations where there are supposed to be several enemies (challenge areas) now have very little. 

Apart from those changes, and a native resolution change, the games are indistinguishable from each other. What it does well is insignificant, what it does terribly is glaring. It's for that reason alone that I would recommend base DS2 over SotFS, and overall, I would recommend playing DS2.

Not taking points away for this but something to note, the default controls for PC are disgustingly terrible. DS1 EE and DS3 have near similar default PC controls to each other and their controls are just betters. DS2 is very different and objectively worse.

Some of the good aspects of the dark souls series is learning and exploration. Dark Souls 2 actively punishes the player. The hallowing mechanic in this game lowers max health which punishes the players for exploring or not already knowing something. The controls are clunky and delayed compared to DS1 EE and DS3. I wouldn't recommend for PC. 

Rolling is also bad. They made rolling bullshit and shitty even with lower load.

Edit after finishing:
The late game is better than the early game by quite a bit. The early game is absolute bull shit. They tied rolling to a stat and didn't give a viable shield until after pursuer.

Also you can help people out; you can be summoned into other peoples world and assist them on killing bosses or clearing out areas to help them advance onto their adventure.

The multiplayer is well done and the mechanics are pretty straight forward with some reading.

The music in the game is also very well done and makes you feel alive when fighting bosses.

They turned Multiplayer servers off and its been off for over a month now. Their first update was today as i write this. There was a exploit that was found years ago they were notified numerous times to fix it and they ignored it until now ONLY because of the Elden Ring and from a hacker being on stream. Their update is there is NO ETA on when it will go back and they took Multiplayer off the steam page i never in my life seen that before. DO NOT but this game.

I truly believe Dark Souls 2 is a great game and recommend it to anyone interested in the Souls games. These games changed gaming and should be played by anyone that likes fantasy games and challenging games. The world in Dark Souls 2 is extremely immersive like the rest of the triligy.

,108843621,"The basic gameplay loop hasn't changed from the original. Two is better than Dark Souls 1 in some ways, but worse in others. Overall, it's still fun, but, as before, it's the kind of fun that you have to enjoy while enduring frustrating annoyances. Here's what changed:

The good: fast travel is available from the start of the game, there are four ring slots, the vanilla game runs at 60 fps and is actually optimised, there are a lot of fun dual-wielding options, and the game's manual is much better than the originals.

The bad: the targeting system is more crap now. There is an annoying delay between an enemy dying and the lock-on switching to the next enemy, so you have to do it manually; and in a group of enemies, the enemy in the very back of the groups will often be targeted instead of the enemies in the front. And even when you are targeting the correct enemy, it is now possible to attack in a direction away from your target, meaning that, for example, if you roll sideways to an enemy and immediately attack, your attack is going to miss by miles; you have to wait for your character to get up and actually face your enemy before attacking. The camera is somehow even worse than in the original, and turns around at inconsistent speeds depending on how long you've been turning it and on your immediate environment. There's been minimal effort to improve kbm support, but it's still crap: everything is just a rebind of the controller's buttons, and there is a very noticeable and unacceptable delay after clicking to attack where the game waits to see if you meant to double click or not -- even with double clicks disabled in the game's settings.",True

,146232180,"It's a good time. The areas are decent, but not the strong point. The linearity makes the game's exploration suffer, and when combined with the instant access to teleportation, diminishes the rollercoaster of dread and relief that I think helped give bonfire discovery in Dark Souls 1 its magic. Functions really well as a boss rush, though. The 2015-2019 run of Bloodborne, Dark Souls III, & Sekiro are where FromSoftware's bosses peaked, and boy does this game (including DLCs) have some great bosses. Weapon variety is kinda bad, though, as most weapons are the same except +2 to damage. Similarly, armor all functions the same. Overall though, pretty good introduction to 2010's FromSoftware gaming.",True
,146234230,"Spent a decent amount of time on this game so here's my little review. As the time of writing, i have not experienced any other soul-like games.
Regarding the lore: this is the 3rd part of the triology meaning that all of the events in-game are the aftermath of the first two series. If anyone interest in the storyline and wants to understand it sequentially, do consider. 
Regarding the difficulty: Soul-like genre is widely known for its difficulty, as a newcomer, i can confirm this. Things can be overwhelmed at first (admittedly, i died too many times because of mobs before reaching bosses.. u live and learn ig or just run) but later on, the game gradually becoming enjoyable for me (but not with farming). You can always call your friends for help if you are in trouble. If you dont have any, the ds3 community is really supportive too. Shout out to them for making my 1st time experience more memorable. 
Regarding the world design: it is linear, some views this is a cons but i say it's great since i don't have to worry about getting lost.
Regarding the theme: DS3 theme is dark as the name suggests but there's beauty in it. Some location in-game are known for their breathtaking scenery. Currently using a screenshot in-game as my wallpaper. 
Regarding the graphics: its graphics quality, imo, the best in the triology( it's the most recent one) 
Regarding bosses: one of the reasons why i chose this game as my starting soul-like game. I was fascinated by many of them. Some of their intro cutscenes even gave me goosebumps. Their variety of movesets combinated with their beautiful ost making the battles even more epic upon defeating...and they will even more so if you know their lore. There are great bosses and not very good bosses but overall, this game has a good mix. 
That's all for now, thank you for reading my review this far. I really enjoy the game so i try to write it as honest as possible even though i never good with words. Have a good day!",True

Other than that, this was the most fun I have had in a game in a while! Here are my favourite bosses, areas, npcs etc. within the game:

- Favourite boss: Nameless King (Soul of Cinder is good especially the second phase soundtrack that plays but nameless king takes the cake for my favourite 
- Favourite Area: Irithyll of the Boreal Valley
- Favourite NPC: Siegward of Catarina
- Favourite moment: Fighting Yhorm the giant (Don't want to spoil but goddamn, the way you beat him with a specific someone *If you do the questline* is so good!)

,30642776,"This game is one of the best games i've ever played :) It has one of the best lores, extremely challenging, The experience becomes better if you talk about the story with your friends and have the volume on while playing :) and much much more <3 

In my personal experience 70% percent of the people playing this game are using 3rd party program or cheat engine or at least around that percentage >.< Thats really unfortunate. So what i highly recommend you to do before activating "" Play online "" or going online in this game is >>> Back up your ds1, ds2 and ds3 file :) How do you do that? Go to >>> This computer or This PC > Users > your computers name  > App Data > Roaming and click on ds3 or any of the ds games :) So now you've got a folder thats  "" Users ID "" that folder contains inside of it a file, That file is your in game progressing save :p Please back up that file by manually copy and pasting it from time to time or even better everytime you close the game ^.^ Paste it into your other Hard Drive ( HHD) or anywhere you feel like it'll be safe in :)

Why do you wanna do all of that? Is firstly because Steam Cloud doesn't support this or any ds games :) So it's not like Csgo, dota2 or many other games that save automatically in your steam account :) so because some hackers with bad intentions not only kill people unfairly and gain little to no fun >.< But they also have bad ways to force a bugged or a hacked item into your inventory that can cause a soft ban or corrupt your files :/ or simply dropped hacked items for you to pick up if you are new to the game that will ruin your system :<

I lost my account twice first time i lost my level 210 character is because i formatted my computer and i didn't know that steam cloud doesn't support ds3 :< And the second time i lost my level 281 character is because i picked up a bugged or a hacked item that ruined my system so i decided to delete all my save files >.< and i've read later on that it's not needed to delete the acccount but the character itself and what i also read that the soft ban ( soft ban is a temporary that prevents you from playing online until you delete or remove the hacked bugged item that you picked up) will go away after couple of weeks but i haven't experienced it myself and i hope i wont ever again >.< Thank you and i wish you the best of luck and a wonderful experience on your ds3 journey :)",True

,146138897,"My honest review and opinion of Dark Souls III
If you just want to know it it´s good and worth playing, YES, it is.
Now to the ""review"" part.

I have to mention, that this is the VERY FIRST souls like I´ve ever played, 
which is why it has a special place in my Heart. 
When I first started playing the game, I thought it was good idea to play it with Mouse and Keyboard.
It wasn´t. In the first few hours I got owned by the Tutorial Boss, locking on and dodging were foreign words to me.
Some hours later, I opened the doors of Lothric and got hit with the breathtaking view of Lothric Castle in the Distance.
I got my first pieces of Armor, Shields and Weapons, and made my way through the High Wall of Lothric. Until this Point the Game was fun, but left me with the feeling of ""thank god it´s finally over"". That changed when I encountered the Abyss Watchers. This Boss took me at least 40 tries to beat, but the feeling of victory, the rapidly beating heart and adrenaline rush was more than worth the struggle. Even though it´s just a game, I was sitting in front of my Desk, screaming ""I DID IT"" for 2 minutes straight to my friends in VC. After the Watchers I purchased their sword and spent many hours by spinning my way through the following areas. Pontiff took me some tries, but wasn´t too bad. Right after Pontiff I got invaded by some guy who quickly noticed that I had no clue what was going on, who he was and why he was in my world. In the end he escorted me all the way to Anor Londo, dropped me a Large Soul of a Hero and black crystald out. Absolute Chad <3
Many hours later I reached Grand Archives and struggeled with Lothric and Lorian, until it ""clicked"". Despite having an Elevator, the way back to the Lothric and Lorian Bossfight is unnecessarily long and packed with enemies. Why Miyazaki, why. After the Twin Princes it was time for the final Boss, and my god, this fight was so good. Soul of Cinder kept surprising me with several mid-phase changes between ""classes"" but was a great experience to fight. Some time after beating the game, a friend gifted me the DLC´s and a had more content to dive into. The DLC´s were great, had many cool weapons, especially the Ringed Knight ones. Sister Friede took me some tries and surprised me with THREE FUCKING PHASES, but went down relatively quick. The Ringed City had it´s highs and lows, but rewarded me with one of the cooles Bosses I´ve ever fought in a Game. Slave Knight Gael took me hours, but holy shit, this fight was an absolute trip and I wish I could fight it again for hours. This fight, the music, the moves and Gael switching weapons MID AIR made this my all time favourite Soul Boss. 
After beating Vanilla Dark Souls III and the DLC´s, I wanted to take some time off, but couldn´t stop thinking on how play it again, more efficiently, using different weapons. 
New Game plus, despite being the exact same but a bit harder, was still an absolute blast.  I rolled through the Game with the Black Iron set, Havels Ring and Heavy Caestus +10, buffed with Lightning or Poison. Past obstacles like Pontiff were a lot easier now and more fun as well. Just imagine beating up a 5m Tall priest with Fire and Magic swords while wearing Boxing Gloves with Metal Notches inside them, it felt so damn good.

After beating several new games, I forced some friends to play Dark Souls with me and it was a whole new experience. Despite some arguing against it, Dark Souls is even more fun when you´re playing with friends, goofing around and beating the game dressed up as Peasants, armed with nothing but a flaming pitchfork. The PvP Experience is also surprisingly good in Dark Souls 3, some encounters end rather quick or even get resolved by one of the players beginning to emote. I´m not an active pvp player and yet I have to say it´s fun, even Invasions can be fun. Some Invasions had actually respectful individuals that bowed down and waited until I cleared out nearby mobs to 1 v 1 them afterwards. 

And then there are these individuals that invade with cheats, such as using Estus Flask SEVENTEEN TIMES, having infinite stamina or reviving themselves after being killed, just to instantly apply the curse effect on you and the point down. These Individuals are lower than low and have to Cheat in pvp, then point down in order to feel anything in their lives. 

The only two things I dislike about this game are cheaters in PvP and the fact that this game DOESN´T HAVE CLOUD SAVE. Fromsoft please, with Dark Souls ""remastered"" you pretty much released the exact same old game and it has cloud save. 

 Every now and then I still start a new DS3 run and get reminded of how much fun this game can be.

,33638254,"Fantastic game, aged like fine wine so far. The graphics are still good despite being 7 years old and most areas are great. PVP is solid (best in series IMO). 

If I were to compare this game to Elden Ring I'd say the first 1 or 2 completions are much better than this game, but the fact Dark Souls 3 is linear it has far better replay-ability. When I play Elden Ring I find myself at the start of the game just running around picking up items, and it really take away from the experience as its quite tedious, but the fact this game is linear, despite many people criticising it, works to its benefit during future play throughs, at least in my opinion.

I will say that getting the DLC's are a must as they are easily the best part of the game. If you're tight for cash and you can only get one or the other, Ringed City is definitely the buy. 

I hope we see a Dark Souls 4 in the future, but if they keep making games equal in quality to this or Elden Ring I wouldn't complain either. Get this game, its worth it even at full price (though it does go on sale quite often) as it truly is my favourite game of all time.",True

,146123893,"[h1] Dark Souls 3: A Brutal Ballet of Death and Resilience [/h1]

Dark Souls 3 is the kind of game that makes you question your life choices, but in the most masochistically delightful way possible. It's a dance with death, and you'll stumble more times than you'll pirouette gracefully. But therein lies its twisted charm.

Imagine a world where death is not a setback but a lesson, where every foe you face is a masterful choreographer of doom, and where you feel simultaneously frustrated and exhilarated. That's the essence of Dark Souls 3.

The game greets you with open arms, then promptly kicks you into a pit of despair. The difficulty level is like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube blindfolded while balancing on a tightrope. It's not for the faint of heart or those with a fragile ego. But if you're the type who enjoys a challenge and finds solace in the feeling of achievement after countless deaths, then welcome to your personal torture chamber.

Dark Souls 3 doesn't hold your hand; it holds your impending doom. It rewards patience, precision, and a hint of insanity. The meticulously crafted world is dark and brooding, with a twisted beauty that beckons you to explore its secrets.

The boss battles are nothing short of epic. Each one is like a tango of death, demanding precise timing and strategy. And when you finally emerge victorious, you'll feel like you've conquered the universe (until the next boss stomps your soul into oblivion).

The multiplayer aspect adds an extra layer of complexity, with invasions and co-op play that can either be your salvation or your undoing. It's a high-stakes game of hide-and-seek with swords.

In summary, Dark Souls 3 is not a game for everyone. It's a dark, punishing, and relentlessly challenging experience. But for those who embrace the brutality, it's also an exhilarating journey that pushes your limits and rewards your perseverance. It's a game that, despite the numerous deaths, manages to make you feel more alive than ever. So grab your controller, steel your nerves, and [b] prepare to die – again and again. [/b]

Poise doesn't exist, miracles and sorceries and pyromancies suck just spam light attack idiot. Why use 1 heavy attack for 150 damage when you can use 2 light attacks in that same span of time for 120 damage each? The devs didn't give a fuck.

The bosses are the only good thing about this game and even then to reach the good ones you have to sludge through shit like Crystal Sage, an overly drawn out game of wack a mole whilst you get belted by magic that will do 50% of your health bar then stun you for long enough for another magic spear to hit you. And then you have to do a 2 minute long run back only to wait for the twat to stop hiding underground and appear with his shadow clones. Or, how about Abyss Watchers? The most overrated pile of shit ever. A gank where the enemies can combo you to shit with long ranged fast as hell sword swings and by the time you stunlock them to death you have to face a phase 2, literally just the same enemy except now their sword hitbox lingers. Fantastic design guys. Then there's the DS2 boss they snuck into the cathedral like we wouldn't notice and right after Wolnir, the most disappointing boss I have ever faced in a video game. What an amazing design wasted on an atrocious gimmick fight, another fight comes to mind just like that too later in the game hmm...also, Pontiff is a bad fight. You either trivialise it with parry or you're spending 90% of the fight dodging this dude's DMC combos and praying he doesn't use one of his unreactable attacks that reach half way across the game's map.

the parts of the game that are original are actually decent, but the combat sucks so much ass compared to 1 & 2, and it won't stop constantly referencing the other games so only ~10% of the game is actual original stuff rather than ""oh do you remember that area from demons' souls/dark souls 1 wasn't that so great we're gonna do it again"" (also ds2 in the dlc but that's negligable).

the combat sucks simply because enemies are too aggressive, which worked well in bloodborne (as much as i dislike that game) but it doesn't work when the player has no reason to be aggressive like how the hp regen worked in that game.

This game is a good challenge, one of my favorite games even having only 12 hours in it. It isn't too hard and it teaches you brutally how to cope with the enemies in the dark caverns of Hallownest.

I will also say that I hadn't held a controller in nearly 6 years before picking this up and it has very much carried my learning curve up and beyond in just a few bosses. Most controls are intuitive, most strategies require puzzle solving and creativity.

This game is brilliant in atmosphere, story elements, combat, environment, map design, enemy design, NPC design. I'd give it 5 stars for every category. Can't wait for Silksong!

Having completed the game now, I can confidently say that this is still one of the greatest stories, games, and experiences I have ever had. Genuine beauty exists in few places on this pale orb called Earth -- Hollow Knight is one.

This game has challenges I still think about while trying to sleep. The sheer enigma of such feelings dwells vast in my psyche as I contemplate my memory of events. A true artpiece.

,147591623,"I played this game in 3 hour increments on my Twitch channel almost every Tuesday from January until September of this year. Of course, by this point many people have played and loved this game, I almost thought perhaps my review would be extraneous at this point. HOWEVER, I would like to say that the way I played this game, I think, made this an even more special experience. 

When it comes to games like Hollow Knight, remembering where you've been and where you might need to go back to later on is imperative to progressing in the story. Most people will speed through the game in the span of a week or two, with everything fresh in their minds. Playing in one chunk once a week was such an interesting experience. I remembered  being places where floors shook, or paths were blocked, but when I got the upgrade that allowed me to progress past these points, I had to explore almost the whole world again to remind myself where these places were, because it had been over a month since I'd been there. This made me feel like a part of the world of Hollow Knight in a way that made this game very special to me. 

It felt like a whole experience. I have loved many games, but very few have made me feel like a part of the story in the way this game did. 

Please play this game if you haven't already, and remember you don't have to speed through it. In fact, I'd recommend you don't. it's okay to take it slow, and experience it one chunk at a time, every once in a while.",True

Edit: Actually I kind of hate it lol. Story mode advertises itself as ""for the fun and fantasy, not a rigorous challenge."" Yet even here, my team gets one-shot by traps and enemies (at our level). After 12 hours, the game basically turned into ""reload simulator.""

According to the internet, if you have problems with story mode, the solution is to ""git gud."" Which is 100% fair in a game that doesn't advertise an idiot mode! Normally I'd approach such an unforgiving game with a guide. But I didn't, and now we're 12 hours in, with a lot of guides suggesting we do a full restart if we're struggling. Honestly, as cool as the game is, I'm not willing to discard a full day's work for troubleshooting...

,145356832,Great game!,True
,145355336,"Have to give this a thumbs down, just because I think this game should sit at ""Mixed"" as an honest representation of the overall experience.

Pros:
1 - Great world-building, interesting story
2 - Character stories are generally engaging, if a little two-dimensional.
3 - Multiple ways to resolve stories, though sometimes it boils down to killing/not-killing someone.
4 - Combat has a lot of potential for interesting ""tactical"" scenarios, though it becomes overwrought (see Cons)
5 - AI has some interesting ways of resolving combat, you won't find too many games with the kind of depth you see in enemies here.

Cons
1 - The Physical/Magic armor addition in DOS2 completely changes the strategic use of crowd control. Enemies, even at Classic level take a lot of chipping away before your skills take effect. The enemy, on the other hand, rarely experiences this issue.
2 - Those enemies are frequently more powerful than you at the same level: more armor, stronger attacks,  more actions per turn, and skills you don't even have access to. It feels less like a straight challenge, and more like the devs put their thumb on the scale because they couldn't find a way to keep the difficulty up without being cheap.
3 - The Source mechanic: underwhelming powers that take waaaaay too many of your action points, which involves a wonky and unwelcome resource management. 
4 - The fire. The endless, annoying fire. This game is a virtual Being-On-Fire simulator.
5 - The Special Fire that you can't put out normally, but have to manage your Source. Fun!
6 - Combat takes a goddamn year. The computer will jump turns, CC you to death, and leave you sitting there watching it play itself for 15 minutes.
7 - The uninspiring character progression - most of the time you're just adding a point or two to an attribute or skill. 
8 - The poorly-realized and ambiguous crafting system, the mind-numbing inventory management, etc.
9 - The overly-cryptic puzzles, and special combat scenarios that (after you get done making a sandwich waiting for the computer to play by itself) are not intuitive at any level.

11- I could go on...

Look, I liked DOS1, and there's a lot of love in this game. But after playing through a couple times (not finished, yet), I just feel like it's so much wasted potential. I haven't found it too hard, it's just worn me down. The combat feels like a chore, and the only way to get through fights is to juggle resurrection scrolls. To me, that isn't ""strategy"". I hope there's a DOS3, I really do. And I hope Larian learns something from making an actual D&D game: the goal of an RPG is to inspire players to overcome challenges, not to constantly cheap them into submission with contrived combat scenarios, and ambiguous structure. Could have been one of the Greats, but Larian leaned in far too hard here, and wound up with a meh experience.",False

The most frustrating thing about multiplayer is missing out on important quest/plot dialogue accidentally while in town, not being able to control who gets to be the party's ""face"", or the ability for party members to comment or switch control during dialogue. Many achievements are not shared by the party, only with the first person who interacts and gets the achievement.

Pure melee characters are really weak in this game due to bad action economy, compared to the first Divinity: Original Sins. Also many of the fights are pretty unbalanced when played straight, but becomes laughably easier when cheesing, such as alpha striking someone without talking to them.

It is a shame, because the game looks great and has great dialogue. But for a studio with this much experience, many of the gameplay elements are a downgrade from the previous game.",False

I also feel like the actual storyline of the game is fairly weak with terrible balance when it comes to certain builds, while also simultaneously plateauing after act 1, with spells just being better versions of older spells without being something new altogether.
I can understand that some people love this game and have played countless hours of it, but I genuinely strugged to play 20 hours of it without feeling something is missing; this, however, could possibly be because of the BG3 release just being a significantly better version of this game.

🔮 Prepare to be ensnared in a world where magic dances with strategy, where choices echo like ripples across dimensions, and where storytelling is an art of unparalleled craftsmanship. Divinity: Original Sin 2 stands as a triumphant testament to the power of imagination and role-playing mastery. 🔮

🌍 Rivellon, the realm you'll call home, is a sprawling tapestry woven with rich lore and intricate details. The graphics paint its landscapes in vivid hues, from the shadowy depths of ancient crypts to the sun-drenched shores where tides of destiny converge. Each character, every blade of grass, is meticulously crafted, bringing this fantasy world to life with cinematic beauty. 🎬

📜 The narrative is an epic saga that unfurls with the weight of prophecy and the whisper of intrigue. Your tale is yours to weave: shaping your character's backstory, forging alliances, and navigating the intricate webs of diplomacy or deceit. The companions you gather are not just fellow adventurers; they're kindred spirits with stories as diverse as the realms they hail from. Each dialogue choice, each action, carries the weight of consequence, weaving a tapestry of fate that's uniquely your own. 🗡️

⚔️ Combat is a ballet of strategy and spell, skill and synergy. The intricacies of elemental interactions ignite the battlefield with endless possibilities, turning battles into exhilarating puzzles where every move can shift the tide. The class system is a symphony of variety, allowing for creative character builds that match your preferred playstyle. The turn-based nature of combat adds layers of complexity and satisfaction, making every victory earned, every defeat a lesson. 🔥❄️

🎲 Beyond the main quest, the world of Divinity: Original Sin 2 teems with intrigue. Side quests and hidden secrets beckon, drawing you into tales that rival the central narrative in depth and emotion. Environmental puzzles and interactivity create a sense of immersion that few games can match, making exploration not just a task, but a journey of discovery. 🕵️‍♂️

👥 Multiplayer transforms the game into a cooperative canvas of shared storytelling. Collaborate with friends to overcome challenges, solve mysteries, and make choices that shape your collective fate. The unique twist of competitive multiplayer, where alliances are fragile and betrayals loom, adds an extra layer of intrigue to the experience.

In summation, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a masterpiece of role-playing craftsmanship. It's a captivating journey where every decision matters, every story finds its place, and every moment is an opportunity for immersive gameplay.

,31154213,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 is an absolute masterpiece that immerses players into a world of unparalleled depth and wonder. From the moment I began my journey, I was captivated by its intricate storytelling, breathtaking visuals, and engaging gameplay.

The intricate web of quests and interactions keeps you engaged for countless hours, and the world is so beautifully realized that I often found myself lost in its fantastical landscapes.

The combat system is a true highlight, offering endless strategic possibilities. The ability to combine spells and skills in creative ways makes every encounter a thrilling challenge, and the cooperative play adds an extra layer of excitement. Whether I was exploring the depths of ancient ruins or engaging in intense battles, I was constantly reminded of the game's immense care and dedication to creating a memorable experience.

Furthermore, the game's soundtrack is a symphonic masterpiece that perfectly complements the mood and atmosphere of each moment. And the level of customization, both in terms of character development and the world itself, is nothing short of astounding.

The expansive world has a lot of hidden secrets and NPCs waiting to be discovered. What mostly stands out are the characters, who are the heart of this game. even side characters are easy to get attached to, each with their own stories and unique reactions to your choices. the game has more than just simple labels of good and evil; characters exist in shades of grey.  I found myself in love with Magister Loke, despite his affiliation with the villains. His vulnerability and loneliness struck something, evident to the game's character depth.

While the main storyline may not be groundbreaking, it keeps one engaged and curious as it continues. many twists and side quests unexpectedly intertwine with the main storyline.

the romance, its execution might not be as strong as desired. despite choosing all male origin characters as companions, the romantic aspects only show up a couple of times per character. Nevertheless, the interactions with companions are enjoyable, aside from the occasional annoyingness  of certain characters, like the Red Prince's fixation on the Red Princess.

my playthrough was with mods, particularly ""NPC Resurrection"" and one that allowed me to recruit any NPCs, which made the game so much better.

,145013398,"I love RPG.s I love what this game tried to do. Take the turn based RPG and turn it into a more tactical fight. It's more involved and requires more skill than just mob grinding until you out gear and or out level the enemies that you want to encounter to progress in the game. That being said, the combat is really killing this game for me. Not that it's too hard, but just that you are always at a deficit when it starts. I've read all of the suggestions. ""Always initiate, move your ranged to high ground, don't clump your melee together."" In theory, great! In actual practice it doesn't play out like that. Unless you are moving the camera ahead of your party constantly instead of just letting it center over you as you walk along,  you are going to just bump into people who want to fight you. The first thing that enemies do is drop an AOE on you and everyone is on fire or poisoned right from the start because you are clumped up just from normal party walking around mechanics. I'm only level 4 and just playing on normal difficulty and almost every fight starts out that way, with ranged attackers already in high ground positions, leaving me to either walk towards them and just get rekt in the process, or walk backwards and kite them. Your own AOE abilities are indiscriminate. So any mage or poison caster is hitting your own team mates and again, you are always on fire or poisoned, or shocked by lighting. There is always some large pool of something bad underneath you that is just waiting to ignite on fire.  I've had an enemy just start the fight by lighting me on fire, I use a water ability that takes several rounds of cool down after usage to put out the fire, and then next turn, the same enemy has no cool down on his AOE fire ability. You are ALWAYS ON FIRE!!!  

My last try I was fighting some woman who was behind a tree, lobbing AOE fire and earth damage abilities at me with the tree in the way. I go to cast spells at her, I can't. The tree is only in MY WAY. So I can either walk towards her for an entire round of combat while she gets off free attacks (And of course I am on fire) or ""kite"" her away because that's the ""Proper Strategy"" that I need to ""GET GUD"". Well she doesn't come after me. Why would she? She's tucked away safe and sound behind a tree that apparently likes her more than me. My main character was stacked with the most gear, and she focused him with 3 attacks and he was nearly dead in the opening round. The thing is, even if I ""Play Properly"" I am still drinking potions and using resurrection scrolls every fight to the point that I am out pacing what I can earn to keep up. 

""Use CC"" great advice. The problem is that you have to melt away the magic or physical armor to do so and with all of the tactical positioning that you are supposed to be doing, you know, because that is what the GUD  players do, and you are burning through that to ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO USE CC....it's at least 3 rounds in. You have already at least drank one potion, and of course.....wait for it.....you know what's coming......YOU ARE ON FIRE!!!!

I wanted to like this game. I really did. But it's not really a tactical positioning game. It's the same tactic being used against me on every fight. Enemy starts out with massive tactical advantage. I lose half my health trying to mitigate the advantage, then when we are finally on an equal playing field, I have to drink potions to survive literally every encounter. PRO TIP, a real one and not just GET GUD KID, don't use poison damage characters. Too many enemies are healed by it and it is really weak. I wish that I had chosen a pyro caster to start the game. Even if I set my characters on fire in the endless puddles of flammable things, they were already going to be on fire no matter what. At least I can burn the enemies in the process instead of heal them with my poison damage.",False

During a late game fight an enemy casted Shackles of Pain on our ranger, the squishiest member of our party. The spell makes it so that every point of damage taken is reflected onto the target, discouraging targeting that specific person until the spell expires to avoid causing damage to another party member. After taking a couple hits our poor ranger was very low on health and I gave the suggestion to just try to run away from the fight and hopefully get far enough to disengage from it. Two enemies, a fighter and the caster started to give chase, but due to their lack of mobility skills they couldn't make it to him. Noticing the distance and the fact that shackles of pain would expire the following turn the AI did the unthinkable: the fighter hits (and crits) the shackles of pain caster, reflecting the damage on our ranger and killing him. The only think that stopped us from screaming in amazement was the fact that we were playing very late at night. 

On that interaction alone I give this game my highest recommendation.",True

,144890974,"[h1]Comentario Analítico: ""Divinity: Original Sin 2""[/h1]

Después de Divinity II en 2009 se tomaron un tiempo para publicar una nueva entrega, pues ahora buscaban algo más cercano a lo que antaño hizo destacar a los CRPGs. Es así que en 2014 se estrenó Divinity: Original Sin, y tal fue su éxito que dio lugar a una campaña de crowdfunding aún más exitosa para financiar su secuela en 2017.

La maestría de Larian Studios en Divinity: Original Sin II deja en pañales al primer juego, que por sí mismo es excelente pero que se queda corto en comparación de su secuela, ahora aún más abierto, versátil, complejo y dado al rol y la interpretación.

Ademas de dar lugar a diversos papeles a interpretar o a formas imaginativas para resolver un conflicto, también dota de absoluta importancia al escenario en cada combate y permite que el jugador se desenvuelva a su modo y de formas muy imaginativas.

Es tanto un CRPG como un Sandbox y brilla en prácticamente todo lo que se propone, véase los NPCs, la compensación por la exploración, los personajes con orígenes preestablecidos, las características innatas de cada raza y las diversas e imaginativas situaciones que se dan a lo largo de Rivellon.

Y además es artísticamente precioso. Visualmente es muy destacable y la banda sonora es preciosa, la música del menú principal es maravillosa.

Now make, by some miracle of mathematics, the game actually BALANCED despite that fact and that is Divinity. The game is surprisingly good at supplying enemies who can deal with whatever weird characters/tactics you can think up too, so the combat is always fun.

If you like freedom in how you play a game without being constrained to meta builds, this is the game for you. The story is a bit meh, but good enough given the amazing gameplay.",True
,144884281,"I don’t think I’ve ever been more disappointed in a game; I’ll give a list about the things that I felt were disappointing. Honestly, the best way to describe this game is that one horse meme that people use to talk about the seasons of tv shows where it starts out a perfectly drawn horse and then as the drawing goes in it gets worse and worse until your left with a derby horse face.  Because the beginning of this game was actually fantastic, I really enjoyed the game up to about the 30 hour mark about halfway through reapers coast (ACT 2) But here is the list of things I didn’t like. If you want to know why I didn’t drop the game, well I was too far in and was stubborn to see the end. 

1.	The inventory system
      a.	I wanted to throw my computer in a pool of lava, it’s the 2nd worst inventory system after Stranded Deep. No Organization, thank God there is a least some form of sorting within the player’s inventory.  You get one chest which if you want to store things in you then must manually drag every item in the chest, with the chest having no sorting system. People say there are ways of sorting your inventory by putting things in bags but even then, that takes time to manually sort all your stuff and it gets seriously annoying trying to find stuff. 

2.	False Promise of “Freedom”
     a.	The game promises a lot of freedom which I feel like it didn’t deliver on. Now when it comes to character creation, there is a lot of freedom. The description of the game says “Unlimited freedom to explore and experiment. Go anywhere, talk to anyone, and interact with everything! Kill any NPC without sacrificing your progress, and speak to every animal. Even ghosts might be hiding a secret or two…” 
     b.	Well you can’t go anywhere so the first point is moot, the game region locks you as you progress, so once you leave an area you can never go back. So if you are a collector like me who likes to collect every unique item in the game. You must do it before moving on with the story. Which is why I gave up on collecting the Unique’s since most become useless after a level or 2. 
     c.	You can’t kill any npc without sacrificing progress, there are a number of Npc’s essential to the story. So that’s a lie. Though many NPC’s you are forced to kill for sake of xp (I’ll explain more in the next part)

3.	The Story/Lack of impact. 
     a.	So my main issue with the main story itself is that its damn short, and very linear. Yes, I’m aware that I have 80 hours in game, but my save is only 62, and most of that was spent doing side quest and making sure I killed everyone for xp. The main story itself was maybe 15 hours but because in order to get to the next part of the main story you have to spend all your time doing side quest for xp and making sure every enemy on the map is dead. The main story on Fort Joy was nice and honestly the most enjoyable part. Reaper’s coast was okay, albeit very simple and short. Nameless Isle and Arx were just plain awful and made me want to drop the game. 
     b.	Lack of Impact, I felt your choices in your quest besides a few decisions like picking your party members and the end of their quest. Have little impact on the story, the only impact the really make is maybe a change in the long end credit scene but you don’t really get to see your choices make an impact in the world around you. Now there are some that do make an impact, maybe if you spare someone you can get help later on in the story. But because xp is so limited, I felt forced to kill certain people for xp. 

4.	Points of No Returns between each act/island. 
     a.	I hated this part of the game, a game that offers “freedom” and roleplaying should not restrict where I go, no I would have understood it, if it was just limited to areas of the game that were past the point of the story since it would have interrupted the flow of the story, but if I’m in arx (the final island) and I want to go back to reapers coast for some unique item I forgot about, I should be able to. 
     b.	On top of that, this game in the transition from act 1 to act 2 forces you to chose 3 out of the 6 followers, to have for the rest of the game. That’s not a decision to make that early since I know next to nothing about them.

5.	Everything about the game is Scripted (Both a Pro and a Con)
     a.	Now normally everything being handcrafted would be a wonderful thing and in some cases it is. Everything feels natural, but because of this we run into certain issues.
     b.	That issue being the xp system is which is unbalanced and take note that this is based on the XP system in the DE, after the XP patches. Which cut a lot of xp out of the game for a lot of different decisions. Now because of how the xp system favors killing everyone in order to get enough xp to be appropriately leveled for the next act, you are forced to do every side quest, forced to hunt down every monster. Since certain decisions give more/less xp you have to pick the decision that gives you the most. Despite me doing every quest in the game (except of few side quest in arx) and killing every enemy npc by the time of the finale I was only level 20, which is the same level as the final boss. The only quest I skipped in arx were because after a quick google search I learned I wouldn’t have gotten to level 21 even after doing those quest, I decided it wasn’t worth my time.  I was already sick of the game at this point. Now of course if you are super good at the game and willing to go at the quest under leveled by all means go for it. But that wasn’t the experience I wanted. 

6.	The Endings
     a.	I won’t go into detail, but I was really disappointed by all of the endings. And both versions of the final boss fight. I ended up watching a few videos to see any other endings i may have missed and even than i saw no reason to replay the game.

it's a good game, or I should say a good idea on paper, but in video game format its... its a WIP.

open world: sure! in the same sense WoW of 2006 was an open world. you can go anywhere, and die shortly therafter or while in transit.

Party: the screens are helpful and useful, damn shame enemies seem to know your weakest character AT ALL TIMES.

Questing: WORST DAMN THING EVER. quest markers NEVER disappear even after the quest is finished! a lot of information WILL NOT be repeated. so if you forget, or someone interrupted you? time to go exploring, meaning as mentioned earlier. Death.

The map: Filled with quest markers, completed and not completed. both use the same symbol, both sound like they are current. you have very little control over the map. you can create ONE custom destination, and thats it.

But the downright most annoying thing EVER is the damn spell mechanics. not a lot of spells, all fo them are underpowered. My guy with a crossbow can three hit someone. My character meanwhile can shoot 6 bolts at the same enemy and MAYBE get them half health.

,147943290,"The developers seem too focused on ""PVP balancing"" and are sacrificing the play quality of the story for it.  Rather than just patch the PVP side to tone down some weapons they have instead patched them across the entire game.  This could get long-winded, but the short of it was there were other ways to fix the problem than making some builds much more difficult to use in combat.  PvE and PvP are entirely different experiences.  PvE tends to put you up against drawn out fire fights, enemies with special powers and resists, and generally a more target rich environment than PvP.  The stun mechanics are hard to balance for PvP as they mean whoever gets the stun off first wins, and that's a failure of the developers for making the game reliant on stun mechanics... it is not a reason to nerf the campaign weapons so I am stuck behind a Dark Souls style die/repeat grind loop waiting for that one ""perfect"" run.  That's a horrible game loop and it denies me the flexibility I once had.

Don't buy this yet.  Wait to see how badly they destroy it for the PvP whiners.

you are the most toxic bunch of whiners I have ever had the misfortune of encountering in games.

However, practice makes perfect, and now I do enjoy strategically planning a build with a certain attack style in mind, and then challenging myself to win using a variety of builds. Played through the entire game 3 times for all the endings, which gave this game a surprisingly intricate narrative (although it's FromSoftware so maybe not terribly surprising). Played a 4th time through to pick up all the battlelogs to achieve the final coral weapons and try new combinations. 

Even post-patch, favorites loadout is coral redblade + plasma rifle + songbirds on a light bipedal build OR coral redblade  + therapist/66EG shock gun + stun needles on a slightly heavier bipedal build. Electricity buildup is similar to BLEED on Elden Ring, and it's very exploitable on almost every boss, and particularly extremely mobile bosses in late game (NG+, NG++). Spent a lot of time using the baby tank treads/wheelchair with gatling guns to move through the first playthrough.

Brilliant gameplay, stunning visuals of industrial environments perfectly merging with the planet's natural scenery, engaging story with great characters (you don't ever get to see ANY living being in this game, yet the dialogues and excellent voice acting do a great job in shaping the characters). 
 The movement in flawless. Move or boost to  ANY direction,  use 4 different weapons at once to delete your enemies.
 Customizing your build to meet the demands of each mission is a joy. Each boss is a different challenge. Ignore reviewers who talk about impossible to beat ImBalAnced bosses. They probably have the nervous system of an amoeba. Bosses are hard only for casual players who don't have the patience to learn how to play. Combat system is excellent.
 Audio design is fantastic, weapons and explosions all have unique sounds. 
 Only negative is the music. The music is horrible, I am not even kidding. Seriously From Software, what were you thinking with those dissonant guitar melodies? 
 I am still playing the game, trying to get better ranking on each mission - which tells a lot about re re-playability of this game. I haven't even started with PvP, still practicing to get better at combat before I head into the PvP arena.

,145001172,"After completing the game thrice for all endings, I feel like my review will be more accurate.
Breaking the game into 2 categories: PVE and PVP.

PVE
The bosses are challenging enough to force you to change your build and the way you play. The customization has more depth than most games on the market, and the weapon choices are very varied. You have to carefully balance your loadout to reach max performance, which is reminiscent of MechWarrior games.
The story is a solid 8/10, with well written characters, great voice acting, and a morally gray theme. Depending on your choices during missions (complete the mission or accept a counteroffer), you will unlock new endings.
The music is pretty lacking compared to previous title and even the Daemon X Machina 'ripoff' though.

PVP
This is where the game is pretty lacking. The lack of matchmaking, progression tracking and rewards, host ping display, statistics, and more chat options are making this part of the game less satisfying. There will always be people using dirty builds, but you can counter any build with your own. Also a definitive plus is the recent balance changes released that nerfed the shotguns.

,147936211,"After waiting 10 yrs for a new installment, I was not disappointed.  The game has a large variety of parts and weapons that encourage build experimentation.  The campaign has branching story paths, and the arena is once again present with a lot of challenging fights.  I found the majority of the missions to be really enjoyable and provided quite a few unexpected encounters.  The story telling is still very ""soulslike"", however its much more clear what is happening than in previous AC games.
The game also encourages multiple playthroughs( its worth it).",True
,147935852,"I never got the chance to play previous AC titles but it always seemed appealing to me. I played demos of the games in the store while my parent's shopped, back when brick-and-mortar stores had console displays and full gaming sections. I had an idea of what to expect, and the game shattered my expectations in the best way possible. 

TL;DR : Armored Core 6 is really good. Laser focused on bringing tight and responsive gameplay. I have gotten all three endings at the time of this review. Story is mid. Your skill will be the only thing to limit your use of any build to complete the game. I have not noticed any major bugs or glitches.

You want to know what it feels like to be a gundam pilot? 

This game plays exactly like the trailers. It feels so good to play that I couldn't put it down. I think about Armored Core while I'm playing it. I think about it while I'm at work, while I'm eating dinner, while I'm buying groceries. When I talk to my friends I peddle Armored Core like my bill money depends on selling copies of Armored Core. This is the first game I've played in years that has been able to hold all of my attention at once the entire time I'm playing it. There is nothing going on in the background of my world while I'm playing this game. Nothing else matters to me except ARMORED CORE VI.

The overall feel of the game is razor sharp. 

The it really feels like the dev team knew what they wanted and stayed laser focused on it from start to finish. Weapon types all feel unique. Everything has a different style of use, a different range of engagement, and different situations in which a weapon system excels. The weight classes really make an impact on your play style, when you add/reduce weight you can really feel it in the movement of your AC. The different parts are, for the most part, all usable in some way or another. I found myself gravitating towards one type of AC over most others early on, but as I unlocked and bought more parts I found my interest in the other styles increasing. I played primarily lightweight for the first two play-throughs with a mix of medium and light for the third play-through. As I've gone back and starting replaying missions for extra parts, rankings, and COAM, I've experimented with medium-heavy builds and really enjoyed the change of pace. I went from hyper-active to slow and methodical. It's been an absolute joy to experience all of it.

I wish there was more to the arena. 

It feels more like it's just there for you to test your AC against the various 'mini'-bosses from throughout the story. You can't progress all the way through it from start to finish unless you've already beaten the game through NG++. You unlock more of 'the ladder' as you progress through the story, I think because it ties into the story/stories. I just would like more of it. More enemies to face, maybe more options to fight multiple challengers at a time etc. Multiple 'waves' like halo:firefight with co-op could be pretty cool. Once I finished I didn't go back and play any of the fights again. I just didn't have a reason to.

The story is passable at a glance. 

It's got some themes and it's got some characters. But they are a backdrop for the game, not it's focus. Like arena I want more from it, but my story telling standards are high and I'm not going to begrudge the game much for not meeting them. I would say if you are looking for a strong, deep, and rich story, you'll be disappointed. I think due to the multiple endings it sort of needs to have a more fluid story line. But I have more questions after finishing the game than I did when I started. It has a story arc and will keep you invested until you've finished all the endings, but it's not really what the game is here to do and I will gladly give the story a pass as favor for the phenomenal game play that has been delivered.

Is it hard or easy? Yes. 

You can really make the game as hard or easy as you like. You can tank up and cheese your way through the game with double Gatling and stun-needle launchers without ever even thinking about your health. You can take a laser knife to a gun fight while wearing paper for armor. The game really shines when you let what feels good to use guide your build. Don't think so hard about the numbers, any build can beat the game. You're skill is the only thing that will limit your build potential. 

I do not think there are really any 'bullshit' moments in the game. 

There are only a few times that I can think of that made me mauld out, but after I calmed down I always found that it was my own ability that was lacking. That I was just a rung below where I needed to be to beat whatever challenge I was facing. Only twice did I succumb to a meta build to beat a boss fight, but it was because I just wasn't good enough. I could take the boss down to the last bit of health but I couldn't cross the finish line. I'm a big fan of the fast, paper thin armor builds, and they have a hard time taking damage from some of the late game bosses. But I will beat them on my own terms with my own build. The game makes me feel like I can do it if I just practice a little more. Now that I don't have the pressure of game completion any more, I feel like I can settle in and just practice these boss fights. To just sit down with a boss and make attempt after attempt until I beat it with my own build. It's the feeling of relentless pursuit of perfection that this game gives me that keeps me coming back even after completion. 

State and stability of the game as of writing this;

It has been patched a couple times. I did not play the game on release, from my understanding a few fights have been nerfed, some stats had been changed before I'd had a chance to play at all. The most recent patch that really affected me was 1.03, a bunch of movement tweaks and some changes to weaponry where made. It felt much more balanced and fluid to me after this patch went live, but it was also about the time I had gained enough skill with the game to start taking note of such things; so take my opinion and observation on it with a grain of salt.

I have not noticed any major glitches, bugs, or game crashes in my time playing. 

I did have a few really weird really bad frame drops [like sub 10 fps] from massive plasma/hardlight effects a couple times during one play session, but this was also during a time when I decided to take a break from some schoolwork and play a couple missions. The PC had been on all day, running multiple instances of Firefox [at least one or two of which was still open], Discord, OneNote, and a half dozen other programs still running in the background, so I consider the event an outlier in general but I mention it as I did need to restart the whole PC in order to fix the frame drop issue. At the time I was not running the latest NVIDIA driver and it was pre-1.02 patch. I only experienced it the once, and I've updated the drivers and not attempted to replicate the conditions so it may be hard to pinpoint what may have been the issue. 

My specs and settings :

My rig is completely air-cooled, running an i7-7800x, 64 gb RAM, gtx 1080ti FTW3, with the game running off a 970 evo m.2 SSD. Load times are sub 10 seconds.

,147932213,"There's just something about this game that had me hooked, even though I clearly suck at it. It took me 60 hours to get all 3 endings, and I probably spent [i]way[/i] more time than necessary on the missions because of how terrible I am, but it didn't matter. Enemy mechs go boom. The game never crashed, it always looked beautiful, the missions are well designed and engaging, with plenty of secrets and optional content to exploit. What's not to love?

About the only thing that annoyed me were the few escort / tower-defense missions, but that's just a mechanic I loathe in general, so I can't really hold it against From for including it. Radio chatter more than makes up for that, up to and including your enemies singing your praises while you cut them down. From really brought this game to life with all of the audio and voice acting; I genuinely felt bad for my various betrayals and tough choices, all in pursuit of the end goals of my handler or those manipulating my decisions.

,147927278,"Amazing game!

Don't expect a super complicated game with a super deep story or whatever with one billion mechanics and one trillion side quest, this is a very simple video game type of video game. You pilot a mech and shoot at other mech, that's it.

First, I want to adress the point that this is a souls game and not an ac game. This is so ludacriss, and nonsensical, I don't understand how people with more than two neurons can even think this, but let's look at the fact. One series is known for mech fight where agility in 3 dimensions is met with high amount of led, lasers and explosions, managing credits earned through short mission with various objectives and side objectives to get additional credit or that will remove credit, also credit loss when wasting ammo or due to repair costs, that currency allowa you to customize your mech based on various restrictions  which allow you to customize your playstile, the other is known for melee sword fight with stamina management and a dash (roll) that gives you iframes, and level design that creates various interconnected routes, as well as incredibly difficult bossfight and a currency system lost on death with the chance of getting back that currency before the next death, currency that is used for both purchases and levelling up. I'll let think for yourself which category of games fires of rubicon  fits better into. And for those that's say, ""well they changed stuff"" or"" they removed stuff"", well of course they did you clown, it's a full priced sequel, I'd be pissed if they didn't change anything, if you want to play the og armored core, just play the first one on the ps1.

Second, I want to point out just how fun this game was to me, it might not be your cup of tea, but holy fuck, was the controls tight. The camera is not that good, and even with sensitivity at max, I found it was still to low, but maybe that's due to me playing super agile build, I love reversed joints.

Third, the graphics and audio are incredible, just amazing.

Fourth, the story is irrelevant, but some characters are good, and voice acting is pretty decent at least in english. However, the writing can be painfully bad at time. ""don't get shoot, or your ac will get damaged"" ""don't die if you want to get out of there alive"" that  kind of stuff. (not quotes from the game, but to me, some one liners, felt this bad.)

Fifth, difficulty wise, it's fine, if not too easy for a Fromsoft game. There was only two bosses that gave me trouble in the entire game, and one of them is the infamous one from act 1. Maybe that's just me who sucks at souls game or maybe I am just good at this game, because I am almost left dissapointed by how easy it is, but at the same time, I often one with very little health left. If I wasn't expecting this game to be hard, then maybe I would've had a better experience, because the difficulty is really good, for a non souls game, but if you were to treat this as a soul game (why would you), then it's way too easy.

Sixth, build variety, I heard a lot of complaints that you can only play a certain way, mainly people saying that since it's impossible to dodge attack, the correct stats is to go quad leg, with full armor and the best damaged weapons in the game, to those people I say: git good. I beat pretty much the entire game with reversed joints and 4 shotguns, just jumping in peoples face blasting them and dodging their attack. 

Seventh, this game is incredibly short. Even when doing almost all of the arena, and messing around building my AC, I still finished the game in roughly 15 hours, and that includes all the time I had to restart due to crashes, which brings me to my following point.

Eight, crashes and glitches, didn't encounter many glitches, not any that I can remember, but SO MANY CRASHES. Always at the same place, by going back and forth from assembly to shop, which made customizing the mech a pain. I had maybe 30ish crashes during my playthrough, almost all of which going back and forth between assembly and the shop, and maybe 3 while loading a mission. I don't remember ever having a crash while in a mission.

Ninth, performance, I had graphics at max I believe, and yet I was still hitting the cap of 120 fps during mission and 60 out of mission about 100% of the time, VERY smooth. Though, I do have a 4090 and a 7950X all watercooled.

Tenth, price, I recommend waiting for a discount, while I would still rank this game close to a 9/10, it is way too short for a full price AAA game, though these days, some AAA games ask for even more, but whatever. If you have unlimited monney or just really want to play it now, go ahead, it's a good purchase, but I'd recommend that the more patien gamers wait for at least 25% discount.",True

,147800770,"I want to start this off by saying that I want to like this game, I really do
But this game just does not hold up very well
Lets start with the good
1. the story is interesting and keeps you somewhat intrigued the whole time
2. the mech customization is fairly good
3. the arena battles are great
4. there is a lot of weapon variety in this game accommodating many play styles
5. the game looks very nice when it decides to do more ambitious environments
Now lets get to what I disliked
1. the games balancing is wonky at best, I did not die for the entire first chapter and the entire 3rd chapter, and I did not die almost at all for the rest of game outside of the main bosses in chapter 2 and 4, said bosses however, are horrible, unbalanced messes of color and fire, most of which do not feel satisfying the fight, they either go down in seconds or take way to long where if you make 1-2 mistakes you die and restart the fight
2. the environments are very, very similar, most of them are quite flat and devoid of life besides the intended path, there are a few that stand out to me towards late chapter 2, but so far, thats pretty much it.
3. many of the weapons seem non-viable, usually because they just straight up do not have enough ammo or do little to no damage, an example would be the napalm gun, its quite cool and does good damage, but it runs out of ammo in 12-15 shots, making it somewhat useless against this games chunky bosses
4. many of the characters in this game are boring and uninteresting
5. most of the other legs are unimpressive, losing mobility options with the tank and reverse bipedal is rarely worth it, and i was unimpressed with quadruped's ""hover"", but thats mostly personal taste there
In short, while this game has good concepts it fails utterly in putting the ""pen to the paper"" in most regards, 
this game is like a 5/10 - 6/10 in my opinion
pick it up if you have any interest while its on sale
have a good day and thanks for your time

,146516677,"ARMORED CORE VI FIRES OF RUBICON as a renaissance of the series, and in general a breath of fresh air against the background of what was released in 2023.
The game was initially extremely sceptical. largely because of reviews and opinions that I heard. I myself involuntarily began to think: robots and robots what to complain about, and most importantly what to admire here
But how wrong I was, perhaps this is the case when it is better not to listen to anyone's opinions and just try it.
Already in the first hours the game pleasantly surprises and skilfully captures attention as a universe, and the possibilities of building. I do not know how the developers did it, but even through the specific presentation of the plot in the course of the game permeate the characters, with whom you want to fight and destroy as possible, with whom the same tears come to tears during the battle.
It is worth noting that the appearance of the game and the whole universe strikes the imagination, being in a huge mech you don't feel big, on the contrary, you feel insignificance in comparison with the whole environment.
The music is in its place and gives the battles an unforgettable feeling and emotion... I can fly...
However, having passed all the missions on S rank I realised that the game is very short, but it was competently stretched in the best traditions of Nier series, and in general Japanese games. And you can understand this decision, the series of games was in hibernation for a long time. But now, when the ground has already been probed and the fanbase of the game has grown a lot, I think the next part will be much more extensive, let's wait.
Overall the game is definitely worth a look!

,145576472,"Armored Core 6 is a game I absolutely recommend for anyone wanting booster-fueled combat coupled with mech customization and epic mission setpieces. I have played Armored Core on every console generation stretching back to the PS1, and can confidently say that AC6 is a fantastic revival of the series after Fromsoft's absence from Armored Core for nearly a decade.
------------
Combat in AC6 is a faithful Armored Core experience and a strong middle ground of past AC titles with new additions. Mobility is not nearly as grounded/limited as AC5, while also not having the energy supply for near limitless aerial movement like ACFA. The introduction of the Stagger Meter to AC is a welcome addition that formalizes weapon hit impact from past AC games into something more fleshed out and very important in boss fights/AC duels. Most weapons feel satisfying to use, and the intricacies of AC melee combat have been refined and well polished with nearly every melee weapon having a unique moveset. The controls overall feel good, I have used both controller and Keyboard/Mouse and both are great to play with.

In regards to AC customization, it is solid but could be better. I think in broad terms the total catalog of parts has a lot of options and is well varied, but old AC players like me will miss the absence of handless weapon arms, shoulder extensions, and other staples from old titles. Quad legs and Tread legs don't get as much love compared to humanoid legs in terms of selection options. That said, there is still plenty of ways you can rollout with vastly different builds, and a lot of the fun in this game is messing around with the myriad possible combinations. For anyone new to AC, I highly recommend examining/comparing parts using the ingame expanded stats sheet, as there are many important stats not displayed in the default tab that will greatly impact your AC's ability to fight effectively.

This game also has a lot of replay value, with a surprising amount of extra content beyond beating the game for the first time. My first playthrough took about 20 hours, but I quickly found out that subsequent playthroughs unlocked more story, AC parts, and other things. Only now after NG++ am I closing in on the finish line to 100%ing the game. The story can be cryptic at times in typical Fromsoft fashion, but I found the story and cast enjoyable and the various endings were satisfying to experience.

Armored Core VI has amazing combat, a variety of combat styles thanks to a wide selection of different weapon types and building options for your ""Armored Core"", and an interesting story to pull you in. Fun and challenging boss fights with good world and story building allows the bosses to feel even more rewarding to beat and enhance that feeling of achievement when doing so.

2: The music is just too good to not put into a playlist and listen to on the go.
3: The PvP could use a little work, but if you get into a community of people who just chill in lobbies, then it's a decent experience.
4: S ranking for some missions is really stupidly easy, some are stupidly hard. It's just a skill issue and you can adapt after about an hour of retrying.
5: Taking breaks is necessary, or you'll burn yourself out. If a mission is too difficult, that's probably your queue to take 10 minutes or so.

I'm anxiously awaiting DLC and will definitely be going back to play other AC games. What an experience.",True
,147905745,Best and easiest Fromsoft game they've made yet! Had an absolute BLAST with this game from start to finish! Looking forward to DLC and I would highly recommend this game to anyone who loves easy games disguised as hard ones! Double Gattling Songbird Stun Needles go brrrrrrrr,True
,147905671,"The salient point of this review is that the PC port is by far the most technically competent version FROM Software has produced. Despite using the same engine as Elden Ring, gone are the shader compilation stutters that continue to ruin their previous effort. The PC version boasts graphical options that can push the visuals beyond the console version as well as support for a 120 FPS cap, with fast loading times, a reasonably good UI, and excellent mouse and keyboard controls. In short, if you felt burned by the port quality from the developer's previous games, the large majority of those issues have been resolved. Bravo, FROM, I genuinely never expected this.

The game is also great. Mecha action brought into modernity with style and flair. The core appeal of building out your custom AC to tackle a variety missions and arena fights is preserved while being balanced out with action combat that rewards skill and snap decision-making. Beefed up melee options and a balanced quick boost that allows for fast repositioning while rewarding careful energy management. However your build generally matters far more, determining your playstyle and making flexibility the most important part of your approach, even if the game makes some concessions to modern controls and shelves the holy turn speed stat of traditional Armored Core. Most of the game is combat, and the combat strikes a great pace for me, without the dizzying speed of previous generations nor the measured your-turn-my-turn of FROM's more recent action offerings, giving you access to powerful offensive, defensive, and movement options all at once.

All of this is coupled with a mecha anime-esque story that I got more invested into than I thought I would. Despite being presented in an extremely dry way through voice over and mission briefings, there are strong characters and memorable moments. The setting and atmosphere are also top notch, and the game gives you lots of details to dig into. It's never mysterious or vacuous but the web of character motivations can really draw you in. Even the English dubbing is compelling with everyone over-acting just enough.

I've also sunk many, many hours into the PvP. I think this is more that Armored Core 6 is basically the only game in town as far as deeply customizable mecha action multiplayer games on PvP, even if the offering is barebones. The dynamics remind me a lot of Custom Robo, where there isn't a ton of balance, but there is a lot of variety if you're willing to dig into the parts kit. That being said, the PvP is the most obviously flawed part of the experience. It's nowhere near as fully featured as some of the previous games, having only rudimentary 1v1 and 3v3 modes, with a skeleton of a lobby system missing basic features. The netcode may be the single worst technical aspect of the entire package. It is just barely better than Elden Ring which was an incredibly low bar. Expect latency to be handled poorly, but you could be playing on the same network switch as someone and still get boost kicked from 100 meters away, with an animation that misses on both of your clients. Visual effects are missing like assault armor which is incredibly deceptive and cheap, the spectator mode is a mess, and yet somehow I keep coming back to it on the strength of the core gameplay. That's a testament to how good Armored Core 6 actually is, but I'm really hoping they take their newfound technical competence and extend that to a multiplayer-focused entry next.",True

Would be cool to see more AC love!",True
,145144489,"[h1] ""Well, Well...I've been waiting for this, freelancer."" [/h1]

I first reviewed this game after 23.6 hours of playing it and completing my first NG run. 

After I got all the achievements at the 65 hour mark, I thought I'd be done with this game and could put it away for a bit before returning.

Instead, I felt compelled to go through the entire gambit again just because I wanted to.

So, here I am at the 95 hour mark after completing the secret ending once more. I still have to redo my S-ranks, but that can wait until later.

Here's just a couple random thoughts of mine, coming from a fan of FromSoft's games since playing Demon's Souls in 2011, though never experiencing any of the AC games prior to this one:

- If the Souls games and Elden Ring are basically playable Berserk anime, then Armored Core VI is a playable Gundam anime. You'll find that most of the enemies just get sneezed on by any weapon of your choosing, until you come across another AC or worse. Hell, some of the bigger tank enemies can pose a threat early on when you're still coming to terms with your build. 

- The story is intriguing and is elevated by some top-notch VO performances, though it can be a little vague at times (kinda FromSoft's tradition at this point). I do wish there was an way of tracking which missions still have data-logs to find, similar to how they track which missions still have unclaimed combat-logs.

- While the core (heh) of this game is to customize your AC and try different ways to approach the various missions, it certainly is possible to find a build early on that can carry you throughout the game and possibly S-rank many of the missions. My advise: push yourself to try new builds. Not only can it help off-set some of the repetitiveness by using new weapons or legs, but it might help you improve your previous builds too.

- This game has a lot of stats to juggle about compared to Elden Ring. More often than not, I'm constantly looking at the detailed breakdown of these parts since the small snippet of stats shown never gives an ideal picture of why you would want a specific part over another. For example, while core pieces will show you how much more EN output you'll get out of your installed generator, they don't tell you other things, like how much your booster is enhanced by your selected core. It might have been more useful to default to the full breakdown of stats OR highlight the advantages that a specific part excels at (i.e. show the melee specialization stat on arms with higher than average values).
	- Also, a video or tutorial explaining some of these more obscured stats wouldn't have gone amiss. Still don't know how much of the ""Firearm Specialization"" I should be aiming for and I shouldn't have to look up Youtube videos to figure that out.
		- Also, the boost stat isn't even accurate for when you're hovering with quad legs or using tank treads, though I figure that might be fixed later on down the road.

- That being said, if you can wrap your head around managing these stats and pick the parts that fit juuust within your allotted energy budget, it can be a blast just ripping through waves of fodder and ACs alike. Whether your hopping/hovering around with the reverse joints/quad legs raining destruction from above, or drifting around ACs with your tank treads letting miniguns loose and popping off missiles and cannons, [url=https://www.youtube.com/shorts/WpmHM1S9_J0]or just driving a pile bunker into your staggered foes[/url], you always have means of tackling even the toughest bosses.

- On the topic of S-ranking, it's a mixed bag for me. On one hand, it can feel rewarding figuring out both the optimal build and path to take that will net you an S-rank. On the other-hand, what counts as an S-rank is woefully under-explained. There's a brief tutorial window that tells you to minimize ammo and repair costs and to not restart at checkpoints. What it doesn't tell you is that you should [spoiler] always be destroying fodder along the way, even if the mission doesn't reward bonus pay for destroying additional targets. This makes high reserve, low ammunition-cost weapons more valuable, but can hurt build experimentation when you don't know if using a large cannon or railgun would dig too much in your ammo budget to reliably net you that S-rank. [/spoiler] I wouldn't say no to a hint system that tells you what you *could* do to improve your A-rank runs, though I suspect any improvements might have to wait until future DLC/newer installments drop.

- I said this the last time I wrote my review for this game, but I do wish there were some co-op options available. Granted, the multiplayer aspect of this game is quite limited (no I haven't touched PvP, not terribly interested in dealing with *the pvp meta* at this time), but like Elden Ring and Souls-likes, I do appreciate being able to help others through the tougher parts of those game and wish I could do the same here. Then again, I am aware that AC V kinda bent itself backwards trying to integrate multiplayer into its campaign missions, so I'll give FromSoft a pass for not wanting to repeat those mistakes here. Still, the ability to cooperate with others, whether helping them in their campaigns or in a horde-like mode fending off waves of attackers, wouldn't go amiss in future installments.

I think that's everything I wanted to say for now.

While the game's not perfect, it was good enough for me to complete it in its entirety...twice. If a game convinces me to play through it again not long after the first run, then that's typically a game that's got something special going for it. I certainly am looking forward to whatever FromSoft brings next to this series.",True

,145485131,"The fighting is way more modernized in comparison to the old Armored Core titles in a very good way. You can see they are trying very hard to SPECIFICALLY not copy Mechwarrior, to an extent of even removing mechanics/parts already in previous titles. This could be them trying to not get lawyers involved or being straight up lazy.

It really doesn't shake the nostalgia bones outside of the art form and vague story telling.

Why the negative outside of what we all expect as gamers from a full priced title these days.

1. It does not have matchmaking.

2. There does not appear to be in game ladders for multiplayer which were very much used and loved for the team and duel tournaments. (this game is all about mercs/corps and mech fighting wtf?)

3. The lack of live service from FromSoftware in every title they pump out leaves little chance much will change at face value, what you see is what you get. Thankfully no bugs or hiccups for me, have been able to play smoothly without interruptions.

4. Not a ton of usable variety with items, once you find something that works/meta you can stick with it most of the campaign. Funny enough some old AC metas are alive and well. I can only see NG+ needing item swaps between missions for shield breaking really. This is especially disappointing when realizing if you build a mech that works, probably everyone else is making that same mech. An attitude that just doesn't place the player in the universe, and removes the desire to mech design or really explore the store.

5. Completionist catering, or more laziness, many items appear to exist simply to earn rather than to use or even test out for yourself.

6. It's honestly hard for me to personally judge an Armored Core game having played most of the old titles. Meaning I'm expecting several years of development and a decades jump in technological advancement... For them to provide something I was expecting 10+ years ago today. Seems kinda scummy, and just a name profit much like GamesWorkshop titles go.


Will you enjoy playing it? I think so for the majority, it's a fun and instantly rewarding dopamine type game. BUT in 2023 and with the hundreds of thousands of game titles available. Armored Core is clearly very down on the list for actual Quality and Customer Service in comparison to how much the game was requested by it's fans, years of development from a world renowned developer, and full price cost while lacking a litany of features.

Conclusion add another full price game to the tally of titles released unfinished.

GOATed balance team
Fantastic graphics

Tons of build possibilities with both offensive and defensive options.

Cons
FASHION SHARE CODES AREN'T CROSSPLATFORM
Opening mission was the most challenged I've been (without it feeling cheap).
Massive difficulty fall off after tutorial (went from oh shit this is hard to wow this is easy). (turns out this was because the easiest way to fight it was counter intuitive)
Arenas is way too inconsistent most of the time they're super easy and maybe 0.1% of the time they just delete you out of nowhere I've replayed them quite a few times).
The menus suck for using a mouse (if they behaved like normal PC UI it'd be far superior)
Mousing over some options instantly changes your menu while others require clicks in positions directly over those mouse overs so you end up in a menu you didn't click on

The gimmick fights kinda suck and some bosses are too easy (especially when you learn the optimal strat for them and no its not songbirds/SNL+chainguns)

So far only one of the last bosses and a boss that gets upgraded have been well designed fights imo.",True

PVP is broken, skip unless you're just like the other high estrogen soys who are either missile soys or tanks.
Melee does no damage to tanks and they basically have no weakness, then there are aerial missile AC's you can't reach.

Assault Armor animation can't be interrupted, and melee builds are basically impossible against the tanks/aerial missile AC's.

,147893717,"I haven't played an Armored Core game since the Xbox 360, and ever since then, mech games have been pretty scarce. I've bided my time with Titanfall2 and Daemon X Machina, but at long last, an Armored Core sequel is delivered to us in the year 2023!

I have exactly ONE (arguably) legit complaint about the game, and it's that the new melee weapons can't be doubled-up on. You can only wield melee weapons with the left hand, and you can technically pack two melee weapons once you've unlocked the shoulder-mounted weapon bays, but you cannot just go in dual-wielding melee weapons. Also I guess you can't exit your mech at will, a'la Daemon X Machina, or Titanfall, but that has ever been the case with the Armored Core games, so there's NO reason to expect otherwise.

I love everything else about this game. The sense of scale frequently shocked me, the game performed smoothly and I hesitate to describe the action as anything short of elegant. The sound design is appropriately heavy and chunky, with the speed of rapid boosts rivaling the anime absurdity of Gundam.

Weapons hit hard, shoulder-mounted SONGBIRD cannons SLAM backward as they launch massive explosive rounds at hefty quat-legged walking bulwarks armed to the teeth with missile salvos.

Please bear in mind, however, that this is NOT a Soulsborne game. There are no i-frames. and the primary solution to all problems is not just ""git gud,"" but also ""build and prep for the situation."" In a way, that makes this immediately either more or less accessible depending on the gaming background you're coming from. The time you spend in the garage tinkering with your Core is just as important, if not MORESO, than the time you spend piloting said Core in a given mission.

I'm hoping this game's success brings us more titles of like design, takings risks and doing exciting new hybridizations and things with the mech genre. I'm also keen to see if we get any DLC in the future, particularly featuring more quad legs and treads. I swear, every time I finished a chapter and received a notification that new parts were available for purchase, I'd run to the in-game shop like a kid on Christmas.

Until then, have fun customizing with loads of parts, custom paintjobs, and an extensive custom decal toolkit.

The main gameplay loop is to customize your mech for the needs of a particular mission, play the mission, get paid and use the money to buy more equipment to customize your mech further; tuning the mech to your playstyle and needs has always been to the center of the Armored Core series, and it was very well realized here:
The mech controls amazingly and super responsively, and its movement can only be described as liberating: you can fly freely and boost up ahead at breakneck speeds, while firing a barrage of missiles to anyone standing in your way; taking down this game's intricate bosses by mastering its movement and weapon options is truly exhilarating.
The customization is very in-depht, as not only are there tons of different body parts and weapons to build your mech with that all play very differently, but the game also offers an extensive editor for the mech's appearance, letting you change its paintjob with very intricate options and a full-blown emblem editor.
As for the story, I wasn't expecting much going into this, and I was very pleasantly surprised to be met with an involved plotline that takes you for a fun, at times emotional ride; the plot also gradually reveals more of itself over the course of multiple playthroughs, which is only an encouragement to keep playing even after the end of the initial (decently short) playthrough.

This game is pretty great and feels like a mix between the PS2 games and the more modern games (it's not as Too Damn Fast, Too Damn Furious as Armored Core For An Answer though). There is heaps of customisation, collectables, secrets and multiple endings, there's also multi-player for those who want to test their creations against other players. 

However From Software (famous for Dark Souls/Demon Souls/ect...) are still patching the game to make it more competitive in multi-player, so don't expect the meta to stay the meta forever (hopefully). There is also a wide variety of missions from protecting/escort, destroying objects and other ACs, even a stealth mission. This game also harkens back to the difficulty of some of the other AC games, so if you're used to getting your butt kicked like you would in Dark Souls/Demon Souls, you should feel at home here, just remember to change up your AC design (the one design generally will not carry you through the whole game, you need to adapt to the mission). 

One thing I did particularly dislike in this game is the stagger system, I generally dislike stagger systems in games (I really hated it in Final Fantasy 13), as I feel like it reduces the amount of viable builds and weapon loadouts. It encourages an aggressive play style that heavily focuses on dealing constant stagger, if you're not dealing constant stagger, you're wasting damage potiential/ammunition. The game also has a heavy focus on melee and close combat, long range combat is not a big thing in this game because projectiles do not travel fast enough to hit most a lot of targets in this game. Hence why this AC games does not have sniper rifles and has had to have some patches to make other weapons like Rifles and Handguns more viable.

Overall, I really enjoyed the game despite my minor gripes, and the difficulty was satisfying, especially after multiple play throughs. I hope we either get some story/mission expansion DLC or some DLC that adds more parts and weapons to the game. Seeing as this is one of the most successful AC games made, I hope we won't have to wait too long for a sequel.",True

Single Player: awesome. Finished this all the way through newgame++.

They do force you to learn new weapons and strategies for each boss which is great (unless your someone that just wants to mindlessly blast through). 

PVP: A game so good deserves better. The game has gone through several balancing patches but the pvp is dominated by max dps tank builds or meta builds that just get annoying. I would love to dodge around trading blows with another fast mech, not dodge an OP tank build until they connect once and the match is over. Wouldn't be that big a deal if there were more than 10 people online at a time and there was anything but 1vs1 available 99% of the time.

,147830314,"I'm normally not much of a fan of big robots, but these ones have warmed my heart to the concept. It's the perfect mech game for people who didn't like Hawken and don't use their titans in Titanfall. An AC in this game on average stands about the height of a midtown apartment complex, and moves at a third of the speed of sound, they are anything but sluggish.

Also, Armored Core 6 is ridiculously easy to get into for the first time, when compared to the previous games in the series. It's far more focused on the actual strategic construction of your mech than it is about the technical skill of piloting and aiming. Your grandparents could probably have fun playing armored core. The PVP scene still has a high skill ceiling though, so returning fans won't be disappointed.

The biggest thing that surprised me about this game is the replay value. I am not going to spoil anything about the story missions, but anyone playing the game for the first time should know that you will want to replay the campaign at least twice to see everything the campaign has to offer. Also, it's a Fromsoft game, so you don't need a new save file to experience the other story paths, you just go into NG+ and keep all your parts and upgrades after reaching any of the endings.",True

There are lots of builds and lots of customization. The story is compelling too; I love the voice acting.

,147819214,"Fresh and new Armored Core experience.

This Armored Core title feels different from the previous titles and when I say ""different"" I mean that as a Good thing, it is a unique AC experience. I have gotten all the parts, missions and endings. Starting at the beginning, back then this series wasn't compatible with Mouse & Keyboard and for this title they did M&K right. How your AC will turn and follow your mouse to the best of its ability (especially with the right parts and upgrades) making it a very good entry for the PC demographic. I have an old setup and using some medium-settings I was able to complete this game with a PC that has a GTX 1050 ti and my experience was mostly smooth. (Only a few times did I experience crashes.)

The way this game does its first mission is different from the rest and gives an impression on what to expect. In previous titles the first-missions would be to just take out the enemy MTs and get use to handling your craft. This game takes the first mission many steps further, giving you tips and clips of how the controls work and missiles being locked to one or multiple targets which is an exciting feature I wanted to have done in an easy manner. While finishing on a challenging boss at the end of the first mission, requiring you to put all those skills to good use, the quick boost, assault boost, knowing when to boost and instantly recharging your energy by being grounded for a short while. I was able to luckily take down the Helicopter boss on my first try by reminding myself that I have missiles.

At the start of progressing in the Arena, you get the feel for the challenge for some enemy types like the Tetrapod MT at the 'Destroy Transport Helicopters' or fighting the D-Ranks in the arena, they feel like challenging bosses when you first fight them. As you progress and gain more parts and upgrades those same bosses (even the harder ones) feel easier as your skills are better honed (or your knowledge of how the enemies function).

The few cons are that there are a few LARGE bosses (Arms Fort-like) i.e. the spaceships and the Strider, another is that there are a few number of part types (one melee weapon per type) one kind of pulse blade and one type of solid-base weapons and only two different Quad-legs (or Tetrapods in this case). Hopefully this will be different if they release DLCs and expansions to expand on the number of parts.

Sorry Ghost Of Tsushima, but you're gonna have to step down for this one. Compared to the rest of the FromSoftware franchise it's different since it's Samurai based, colorful and as I said just has sick combat. And just like the other Souls games, this one is even better with mods. You should definitely check out Elden Arts or Ressurection mods for some extra spice and download some sick fits and effects just to keep it more interesting.

The combat system - which I'd compare to a dance with its fluidity and rhythm - is unforgiving but fair. If you die (expect more than twice), it's on you. It's simple on the surface, but once you dive into it the complexity appears. Especially on subsequent playthrougs with most of the things ulocked. The combos you can pull are very satisfying.
The story is different to what we're used to from FS. It's not as cryptic, is straightforward, and the premise is simple. But of course, the world is beautiful, filled with an enviromental storytelling and details. The power to pull you in and care about its characters is there.

,147182982,"This game often gets lumped together with FromSoftware's ""Soulsborne"" games but in my opinion it stands apart from them and also above them in some respects. 

While the map is slightly ""open"" it is presented in a fairly linear fashion and you will not get lost as easily as in their other games. It also has verticality because you can leap relatively high  and zip around buildings with a grappling hook like Spider-Man, it makes the world more fun to navigate. Most RPG mechanics have been stripped down, there are no stats to spend points in, only skill trees and a tree for your secondary tools which enable you to do things like throw shuriken, blow fire et cetera. 

There is a fairly well designed difficulty curve in my opinion, it obviously gets extremely challenging at parts, but with challenge comes the immense feeling of pride and relief after victory. The fighting is very fast-paced and engaging, it feels very rewarding to grasp it; basically you build an enemy's Posture with attacks, counterattacks and especially parries to the point you can use a finishing blow; and you do this twice (sometimes more or less) on bosses. You don't have a stamina bar, instead blocks (which completely negate damage) will fill your own posture which will result in a broken guard if it fills up entirely. Obviously this is different from their other games, so it's important to approach this game on its own terms without any preconceptions from other titles. 

I will point out however that sometimes you will have to ""grind"" for experience or sometimes even currency to get an upgrade that you want or need. Because the combat is so fun this isn't _that_ tedious but you definitely won't level up every skill on a base playthrough. The skill/arm trees hide future abilities from you that are gated behind upgrades, and you should know there are skill trees you may or may not discover through your playthrough (I recommend unlocking them all). This is a bit annoying because you may realize too ate that you wasted points on something that doesn't have anything interesting or valuable behind it and then have to go grind points for the brand new skill tree you unlocked that has a really good ability at the end of it. Occasionally useful combat abilities will be hidden behind innocuous passives like more money/drops or something like that. Therefore it may actually behoove someone to look up the skill trees before hand and decide what to invest in so you don't waste points/materials.

I think that anyone who really enjoyed this game should support the title ""Sifu"" which borrows certain ideas (namely posture and resurrection) and also expands the combat system quite a bit to the point of being uniquely special. I think coming from Sifu, a game which also emphasizes parrying, really helped me understand Sekiro quickly, and the skillset definitely transfers across both games. 

Disclaimer I only did the ""Severance"" ending. Note: there is a decision midway through the game which determines the course of the remainder of the game, and without spoilers I highly recommend the SECOND option as the first option will make the game end much faster. 

All in all, this was definitely a special experience and one of the best games I played in a long time.",True

- Sekiro is FAR from perfect... Certain level and enemy design withhold this game from the heights Elden Ring but this game far exceeds any and all expectations for raw combat.

Gameplay: Combat was a challenge unlike anything I've experienced in a game before and I absolutely loved it. Every single enemy needs to be taken seriously; this requires a high skill level, but the game does a great job of making that process fun and it makes the victories so much sweeter.

The most relieved I've ever been to finish a game. 

This game has some really amazing moments, and beating a boss that was whooping my ass for hours was definitely relieving, and usually satisfying.

I don't know if I was able to Git Gud to the level I'd like to after beating the game, but can fairly confidently say this is low on the list for playing again for several reasons.

1) I want a big sword or hammer to bonk stuff with. The fast combat is very well done and feels really cool when you get into a tango of slashes, parries, jumps, and dodges, but something in the pacing of many fights just didn't feel great to me.

2) ""Bugs?"". Lets start with the for-sure bullshit. Some of the hitboxes for attacks are just ridiculous, so learning their bullshit is key to success. The rest, I don't even know if these are legit or just me on copium. This happened mostly on some of the later bosses, but I would be fighting a boss and he would go into hyper-mode and start firing off attacks that are usually warned by the red symbol without any tells. Sometimes they would go from the end of one attack chain directly into an attack that I had only seen halfway through another combo, or link multiple multiple combos in a row, then never do it again. I'm sure some of this is simply more infrequent moves being shown due to the amount of attempts I took on some of the bosses, but I think some of the high attempts were also due to unnecessarily confusing fight logic that took a long time for me to learn. The timings on moves seemed to change just enough so my learned timings were wrong, a lot, especially as I got deeper into the attempts. Maybe my brain was just turning to mush, but I said ""What"" with varying inflections more than any other game I've played so far.

3) Lack of numbers. I love damage and health numbers, and the tease of a poise bar being at 99.9% and going for the expected deathblow got me more times than I'd care to admit. If I could see the actual numbers on why events did or didn't trigger that would be awesome and help with the feeling of being screwed. I guess it would take away from the visual flow of the game, but I still love my numbers and seeing them change as my build and skills do.

""Similar"" games I've played: Dark Souls 1, Monster Hunter World.
DS1: Oh how I wished for a true strength build in some of these encounters. A little piece of candy and some confetti just doesn't match up to my halberd. Sekiro's idol (checkpoint) system is way more forgiving, and warping between the many locations for vendors, farming, quests, and whatever else you might want felt really nice. The boss run-backs are all really managable, and getting repeat ganked by mobs on the way to the boss is a rarity. If you feel like you need some currency, farming is quite easy and fast with a few of the idols. I absolutely loved my first playthrough of DS1, and while this was also an amazing and beautiful experience, I think I enjoy the less-samurai combat more. I'll keep playing through the Soulsborne catalog as things go on sale, but am definitely looking forward to getting my weapon and equipment freedoms back.

MHW: A few of the fast weapons in MHW feel kind of like the fighting in Sekiro, but they play so differently I think the combat is the only similarity I can think of. And maybe the grapple thing but Sekiro's is way more fun. That said, now that I've beat the main story of both, I've continued to put time into MHW, and after just beating Sekiro, I really don't think I'll play it again, unless maybe a buddy gets it and I'll go through it again with them. There were times in Sekiro that I really just wanted to Git Gud and be done. I have consistently fun play sessions on MHW with very little frustration, and I can't say the same for the same percentage of Sekiro sessions.

Conclusion nobody will make it to:
Sekiro is a great game and mostly very well polished. Some of my frustrations with the game could be simply my inability to play well enough, but it felt bad in a way I hadn't quite experienced before somehow. The satisfaction of learning a fight wasn't quite there compared to the time it took me to learn them, but that could just be my ego talking. Steam says 51 hours played, I'd guess maaaybe 10 of those were idle time where I forgot the game was running. At a solid $30/40+ hours of gaming, I'd say it's well worth the money, because I got the have so much of an experience in that time.",True

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Looked all over Steam for a decent shinobi/ninja/stealth game and this was the highest recommended. After playing and loving DmC 5 and similar games I decided to give this one a try though I knew this one would have a DS-like approach in terms of difficulty. All that said, when the game has sloppy programming behind it, I just have to complain. I'm fighting that chained ogre in the earlier levels and the dude literally did an instant, 0-frame 90 degree angle in midair when he dove to grab me *after completely evading him.* They got some messed up hit boxes up in this game. If you're looking for something fun, prepare to invest DOZENS of hours to become a master first to THEN start having fun. There's rarely an instance where you could interrupt your opponent with a slash... especially considering your character isn't the fastest sword swinger to begin with (at first anyway).

If you approach this game with the mentality of ""I know I'm gonna die 1,000 times on the first level"" and have the patience of a saint, then you're good. Otherwise, steer clear of this game.

,146807154,"Great game, very challenging, satisfying, and rewarding. It looks incredible, both graphically and artistically. The animations are fantastic, hands down the best of any FromSoft game in my opinion. Finally getting the deathblow on an enemy you've been struggling with and deflecting all of their attacks once you've learned their moveset is so satisfying - visually, acoustically, and mechanically. I'd say Sekiro is probably more difficult than any Dark Souls game, but the revives and prosthetics are clever and fair ways of easing the difficulty when it's needed in really tough fights. 

Now, for the issues: 

The camera and lock-on systems are easily Sekiro's weakest feature. Both are very rudimentary, and don't seem to have changed much since Dark Souls or even Demon's Souls, games from 2011 and 2009 respectively. The lock-on and camera in those games was already poor, and with Sekiro's increased focus on both the player and various enemies moving further distances more frequently during combat, the problem is exacerbated. They are a frequent cause of frustration, especially if you get backed up against a wall or are in an enclosed space, are fighting multiple enemies, are fighting an enemy that moves around a lot (double glaive monks are the worst offender here), or have to look upwards at an enemy or a grappling hook spot. Throughout my playthrough I couldn't help but see the revive system as a band-aid fix for the frustration caused by deeper design flaws such as these, and it's a wonder FromSoft hasn't improved either the camera or the lock-on considering the amount of work and care they put into developing almost every other aspect of their games.

The platforming is awkward, especially when the sprint button forces your character into a dodge every time you start moving while its held down, which is annoying when you need to sprint on a ledge or a rooftop. 

Several bosses and enemies are so loud that they cause the game's audio to peak, which was incredibly irritating and may hurt some people's ears. The audio peaking was worst when reverb was involved, such as the bell-wielding Taro troops slamming the ground or the Guardian Ape thrashing around in the water. 

Some of the mini-bosses are more difficult than the actual bosses (Juzou the Drunkard and Ashina Elite, for example), and the game has loading screens in 2019.

While there are things to be improved, the gripes I have are relatively minor compared to how great I think the game is overall. Highly recommend it to any fan of FromSoft's games, just be aware that it has its fair share of issues.",True

The game is really fun and the synergy between all the equipment you can get is fantastic, but I have two complaints about the game. The fist is the final boss. You're placed in a very small arena and the boss has very quick attacks, which can kill you in two hits. I used the training area to practice against this boss, but I still couldn't get it down. I think this boss battle difficulty is too high, even on custom game mode. The second complaint is how long it takes to unlock things. The game takes a lot of grinding, even for costumes.

Overall probably one of the best rougelikes out there! But there is a problem with these sort of games (at least for me) you get so far only to get 1 shot walk away with nothing after losing.

They even include some weapons and skins from other indie games, such as Risk of Rain, Hyperlight Drifter, Blasphemous, Hotline Miami, etc. to keep things spicy at no extra cost

Can hop in and hop out for a few runs at a time, get frustrated at getting ganked by a bunch of enemies and take a break, then hop right back on again the next day. An utterly satisfying experience, if you are willing to tackle the challenge. Assist mode makes the game more accessible (have turned on infinite deaths now and then to guarantee getting some unlocks here and there), but being able to go toe-to-toe with the base game and its mechanics is such a rewarding experience.

,142911963,"Dead Cells is an adrenaline-pumping and addictive action-platformer that will keep you hooked for hours on end. With its dynamic combat, procedurally generated levels, and stunning pixel art, this game offers an unforgettable experience that leaves you craving more.

[b]Graphics:[/b]
The pixel art in Dead Cells is a visual treat. Each environment is meticulously crafted, from hauntingly beautiful dungeons to eerie forests and treacherous castles. The attention to detail and smooth animations add depth to the game's world, making every moment visually engaging. The blend of dark and vibrant colors sets the perfect mood for the game's challenging and atmospheric gameplay.

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
Dead Cells' gameplay is where it truly shines. The fast-paced combat is a joy to master, offering a satisfying mix of sword-slashing, arrow-shooting, and spell-casting. The game's ""Roguevania"" approach, combining rogue-like elements with the exploration of a metroidvania, creates a compelling and ever-changing experience. Each run feels fresh, as the levels, enemies, and loot are procedurally generated, keeping you on your toes and encouraging experimentation with different playstyles.

[b]Audio:[/b]
The audio design in Dead Cells complements the gameplay perfectly. The ominous soundtrack sets the mood for the intense battles and exploration, while the sound effects provide visceral feedback to your actions. The clashing of weapons, the creaking of doors, and the eerie echoes of the environment immerse you in the game's dangerous world, adding to the adrenaline rush of combat.

[b]Story:[/b]
While not heavily story-driven, Dead Cells offers subtle hints of lore that pique your curiosity as you progress. The game's mysterious narrative and enigmatic characters encourage you to piece together the game's world and history bit by bit. It's a testament to the game's design that even without a prominent plotline, players find themselves drawn deeper into the game's secrets.

[b]Difficulty:[/b]
Dead Cells strikes a satisfying balance between accessibility and challenge. The initial stages provide a smooth learning curve, allowing new players to get accustomed to the mechanics and enemies. However, as you progress, the difficulty ramps up significantly, demanding quick reflexes and strategic decision-making. Each death feels like a learning opportunity, motivating you to return and improve your skills.

[b]Grind:[/b]
The grind in Dead Cells is thoughtfully balanced. While gathering cells and blueprints to unlock new weapons and abilities requires some effort, it never feels like an overwhelming grind. The diverse and rewarding upgrades make the progression feel worthwhile, encouraging players to explore different paths and strategies.

[b]Game Time:[/b]
With its replayable nature and ever-changing levels, Dead Cells offers a significant amount of gameplay. Depending on your skill level and desire to uncover all its secrets, you can easily spend tens to hundreds of hours immersed in the game's challenging and addictive world.

[b]Price:[/b]
Dead Cells' price is well worth the experience it offers. The depth, variety, and replay value justify the cost, making it a standout title in its genre.

Dead Cells is a triumph of game design that sets a new standard for action-platformers. Its addictive gameplay, stunning pixel art, and engaging audio create a seamless and immersive experience. If you're a fan of challenging and rewarding games, Dead Cells is an essential addition to your gaming library.

,148491813,"This is the game I always wanted and never knew. 

MOST IMPORTANT PART: Originally, I never picked up this game because I heard how soul crushing, Souls games were. I'm just too old and tired and averse to frustration, to do 1980s arcade style repeat over and over again frustrating encounters. That said, I enjoy very challenging experiences (like playing Skyrim on Master), but don't want to do “one wrong move and you die” and lose everything. I also was very turned off by everything I read about lack of quest and dialogue journals. I don't need my hand held tightly but again I'm an adult with many cares in the world, I can't possibly remember conversations, lore and directions from days ago after a long week of work. Well, if you're like me, forget your fears.

As I told a friend, I dk if I can ever get passed a single boss, or will get stopped along the main quest bc of that, but I don't care. I have 25 hours in the game, and I LOVE LOVE LOVE everything I see. And the more play, and learn, the better it gets. Don't worry about the above fears. You can explore the world endlessly (so it seems to me, although I'm only the first two provinces? Maybe it's one province? I'm not sure) and never fight a boss. Often times, if you are clever and quick, you can even loot part of the boss areas without getting caught. I really don't care about main quests. I put 300 hours in Skyrim and Witcher before I ever finished their main quests. 

Also, at least so far, dying is not a big deal, really. First, you have (a single) chance to recover the Runes (money) you lost if you die. If you do, no harm no foul. If you die again, then you lose it all. BUT, you find Rune alternatives everywhere that hold their value even if you die and you can trade them in for money. Also, every time you rest, everything comes back to life. Annoying right? Not really. Skryim regenerates monsters after a month I think, and Witcher after only a day or two. So big deal. Also you can fast travel or ride quickly on a horse, past ""cleared"" areas, so you really lose no time at all, you don’t have to retread “regenerated” ground if you don’t want to do it. It's not needlessly repetitive unless you want to keep fighting things to improve your technique.

Speaking of technique, the combat is the most fluid I EVER HAVE SEEN. It puts poor Skryim (1,200 hours love you) to ... I won't say shame, but retirement. Picture Call of Duty responsiveness but D&D style combat. Your choices absolutely matter. Your loadout affects your abilities and weight which also affects your effectiveness. And if you make a mistake on your “build” I believe eventually you can respec quite freely. I'm using a Prophet (just bc I thought it looked cool) but am experimenting with all kinds of stuff for now.

Monsters themselves are some of the most diverse I ever seen. Stuff I never imagined before. Even “boring” ones you have seen time and time again like goblins and undead, can surprise you with different loadouts and weapons and abilities. And their abilities and loadouts are not just for show. And, many creatures are grouped together quite naturally. You will very early on see a group of ... I dk sentient undead? With peasants, village guards, actual knights, champions, and court wizards, all naturally fitting together perfectly. I mean, really some of the most consistent and logical creature group designs ever.

The graphical environment is on par with Witcher 3. I am not kidding, but I spent quite a bit of time simply sitting on my horse, upon a cliff, overlooking the ocean, just watching the sun rise, rays coming off the sea through the trees.

The real beauty though (although this is the most fun I ever had with D&D combat) is the exploration. That's the reason I live for in these games. I ignore the quests and just walk or use the horse to go on the same trails back and forth. At night things even change. I can't tell you how many times I have traveled back and forth just to find a new crypt that was hidden somewhere in the brush or under a building.

In summary, if you're like me, and too afraid and tired to be frustratingly crushed over and over again, DON'T WORRY. There is plenty to do, while ignoring all that. As I told my friend, if I spend 50-100 hours just exploring the world and fighting ""regulars"" and finding treasure and stuff without defeating a single boss, it was worth it. The one caveat is that you do sort of have to pay attention to NPCs bc they don't often repeat themselves and there is no question or lore journal and that is my only complaint. I don't need to be told go here, but I would like a record of information I have collected. Grr.

Final note: Don't be afraid to experiment generously with mechanics and settings. I couldn't hit anything at first bc I foolishly turned off ""LOCK ON"" during settings bc I thought that cheating. Eventually, I learned ways around it, but I found odd and frustrating problems like there was no ""side step"" so when an enemy jumped to the side of me I would try to side step to sort of keep my shield in front but move to the side, but instead I turned around and exposed my flank. If you play with LOCK ON, you do sidestep and always face front. BUT, if you need to dodge roll far away (to safely drink a healing potion) you can't if you are locked on (you can roll not far away). So, I learned to LOCK ON, LOCK OFF. Stuff like that. I went from losing most battles to winning most of them :)",True

Ill target lock a massive, building sized golem, and then somehow be chasing an eagle after i roll through his legs. You have to be so incredibly careful to not touch the right stick AT ALL or else you're not going to be aiming at you want to be anymore. This is only most of the time. Theres plenty of inconsistency where you can pull the camera a little bit more in a certain direction while you are locked on. Never know if you are allowed to look somewhere or if the game is going to fuck you. Not only that, but if you managed to stay locked on to something the spinning of the camera will make you sick. Its so damn hard to tell whats going on beyond a flurry of legs and arms. It makes looking around the most difficult part of the game, far harder to deal with than any boss pattern or situation the game presents. Worst camera I've ever dealt with no exaggeration.

The game doesn't really have a story, but it gives you options, just not at the start. The beginning of this game is pretty much come back after you have leveled 15 times so you dont get oneshot by the boss it sets on the natural progression.

This is the perfect example of an AAA Soulsborne game. Sadly the Endboss is completely unpolished. 

Radagon (phase 2 / 2)
1. HEAVY input reading
2. animation cancel from various windups and even out of his own teleports INTO his next teleports
3. tracking from some attacks is also off (dude just curves to you in a 90° angle mid dash)
4. and lastly the infinite attackchain where he spams up to 12 consecutive lightnings or light hammer attacks. If you fail to dodge one, the followup will kill you.

And of course phase 1 & 2 / 2 from Elden Beast is running simulator with additional
4 spammable large AOEs
3 gimmick one shots
and 1 grab attack (also 1 shot) you have to stack every holy resistance in the game in order to not restart 

Worst 2 bossfight(s) i ve ever fought in ANY soulsborne game, EVER.

Ironically this game also features my favourite bossfights of all soulsbornes i ve ever played.
Mechanically it s Morgott. Even with his windups he just feels genuinely clean to play against, i even like him more than Godfrey, despite Morgott appearing 3 times i never get bored fighting him.
Visually it s Dragonlord Placidusax. The theme, the surroundings, the animations.. kinda speaks for itself..
One word; stunning.

What this doesn t show is that i also played this game somewhere else and i managed to get into the late / endgame with most major build this game has to offer, excluding some nieche hybrids that are probably just as fun.

builds
favourite: FAI + DEX hybrid (multiple times; ancient dragon lightning, blackflame)
FAI
ARC
FAI + INT hybrid
DEX
STR
INT
Every single one of them was fun to play and experiment around with. 

The graphics are outstanding.. like they re just something else..
If you like soulsbornes, it s a must have.
Note that the multiplayer / Co-Op is horrible but thankfully there are mods to aid with that. About modding, there are some really neat mods in general.

Se eu recomendo? Sim, caso você feche uma pt com 5 amigos e joguem numa boa, do contrário é só estress esse jogo, comunidade tóxica, lixo, não presta, faz você literalmente sentar na frente do pc e querer desinstalar o jogo, pois deixa de ser algo divertido, um passa tempo, algo prazeroso, pra ser algo extremamente estressante, o que infelizmente, a Valve, não faz nada pra resolver...
