,149026073,"I tried this game in preparation for Elden Ring over a year ago and stopped at Blighttown. It being my first soulsborne, it was truly an experience filled with wonder and rage. One example of wonder would be me taking the lift under the first bell tower. One example of rage would be the walk back to the Taurus Demon. That is probably the most mad I had been at a video game in a very long time, but being more well versed in these types of games now, I look back on it and laugh.

Coming back over a year later, and after beating Elden Ring, I must say this game has so much to offer. The only stipulation being that you are willing to put in the time to learn the game, and to get better. Coming into the game I had so much drive. I wanted to beat every Dark Souls before Elden Ring came out, just to have that experience. just to not even get halfway through the first game before calling it quits. After giving it a second go and completing it, I will say that you shouldn't throw in the towel, or you're going to miss out on one of the greatest gaming journeys I've been on. 

This game, for newcomers, will beat you down over and over again. The game, for players who have played before, will beat you down over and over again (but more fun this time).

As of right now, I'm early on my Dark Souls 2 playthrough and I can only hope that it, and Dark Souls 3, can hold a candle to the greatness that is Dark Souls 1.",True

,148889481,"My introduction to anything soulsbourne or souls-like was Elden Ring, followed by Sekiro.  Feeling inspired, I decided to take on the classic trilogy, starting with Dark Souls I.  Being a much earlier game, you can tell the graphics and gameplay were still in their ""working out the kinks"" process, but that doesn't stop this game from being a masterpiece.  It may not have the open-world aspect that Elden Ring or match it's beauty in world design, but it is truly a work of art.  The way the world is all linked together and the main storyline are what drive this game and I'm all for it.  I definitely need a guide for a few parts to see where to go next, but other than that, the game is fairly linear without forcing the player to make one decision or another.  I, personally, found this game  lot easier than I was expecting (thank you, Sekiro), but that allowed me to focus less on grinding to prepare for a boss fight and more on the story that I'm experiencing.  Overall, this is a 10/10 game.  Takes a little bit of getting used to with a fairly steep learning curve, but I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to enjoy a classic.",True

,146708102,"TLDR: This game is an unfun, dated piece of trash. I am genuinely surprised that Fromsoft decided to continue the Dark Souls trilogy after making this offense to gaming.

Dark Souls Remastered was some of the least fun I have ever had in gaming. A mixture of terrible combat, horrendous level design, awful bosses, and ugly graphics come together to create an overall garbage experience.

Let's begin with the combat. Wow, it's bad. Like really bad. When I played I tried almost every build. While the weapons were different, they all had one thing in common. They felt like shit to use. I tried straight swords, greatswords, curved greatswords, katanas, rapiers, axes, spears. I even fucking tried bows if you can believe it. EVERYTHING FELT LIKE SHIT TO USE! I ended up settling on a pure magic build. While magic still felt overall bad to use, it was the best option because it got rid of a lot of the bad mechanics that plagued melee weapons. One of the main issues that I had with the melee combat was the fact that if a pixel of your weapon made slight contact with a wall, it would stagger you. Enemies did not suffer from this which lead to bullshit situations where you were not able to hit enemies if they happened to be in a tight hallway or something similar to that. This is just one of the many things that really stood out to me. Combat was generally unsatisfying and clunky.

Next, let’s go over the level design. I don’t even know where to begin with this. With the exception of maybe Undead Burg and Undead Parish (the first couple of areas of the game), the levels of this game are laughably bad. It’s honestly kind of impressive that they managed to make a world this terrible to traverse. I wouldn’t be surprised if they held some sort of contest when making this game to see who could make the worst level. I know I keep going on and on about the level design, but it’s actually that bad. Blighttown, Sen’s Fortress, Anor Londo, New Londo Ruins, The Duke’s Archives, The Catacombs, GODDAMN NEARLY EVERY FUCKING AREA IS DOGSHIT! I kept telling myself that there was no way that the next area could be worse than the last and I was wrong every time. The only redeeming quality about the world/level design is how they link a few areas back to Firelink Shrine. They only do this about three or so times that I can remember though.

Finally, let’s end this negative review by talking about maybe the most important part of a Dark Souls game, the bosses. If you were hoping for me to say something positive about this, sorry they are bad too. I guess you can say they fit the vibe of the level they are in. Sadly the vibe of each level in this game is ass. The best bosses in this game are mediocre and the worst ones are downright offensive. Capra Demon and The Bed of Chaos are genuinely some of the worst bosses I’ve seen in gaming. Bosses that generally get praised in the Dark Souls community such as Ornstein + Smough and Great Wolf Sif are barely any better.  

Dark Souls Remastered consists of bad combat, garbage level design, and unfun bosses. I am absolutely flabbergasted, fucking astounded, that some people consider this the best game in the trilogy. I feel like Fromsoft should come to my house and apologize that they made this mess that I played through. I would not recommend this game unless you dislike fun, or if you just want bragging rights saying that you beat the game.

Like I love how the whole world is connected, but not being able to teleport between bonfires for the first half of the game sucks. There is also a lot of areas that I absolutely dread thinking about, but there's also so many memorable parts and places and so many things I really enjoyed seeing in DS3 as well. Also the co-op system is so awful, like you need a humanity (equivalent to an ember in DS3/furlcalling finger remedy in Elden Ring) but you need to scroll through the awful menu to find it, and once you use it, you need to sit down at the bonfire just to be able to actually activate it..and it's quite limited at the start but eventually you get a reliable source of it.. But even though this version of dark souls 1 is ""Remastered"" it still has its issues and jank and you can just tell its old lol. I definitely recommend playing this game solo, and I'm sure this game might be better if we had a lot more QOL changes from DS3 and Elden Ring, but regardless I really think Dark Souls 1 is one of the best!",True

,148815536,"The Dark Souls of Dark Souls games. 

What I would consider the last seminal release of the AAA video game industry, a one-of-a-kind title even the original developer can't seem to fully re-capture the magic of. The cornerstone and main highlight of the game is the world and level design, everything is interconnected with multiple paths to reach different places with numerous shortcuts to help progression and ease backtracking. With no fast travel in the game until the last 20% or so this gives the game an incredible sense of immersion. 

Further helping with the game's immersion is its sparse use of music, reserving its sparse tracks for the games boss fights and only 4 in game areas; the only thing you will hear throughout most of this game is your own footsteps and the sounds of your environment. While there isn't much music each track is memorable, Gywn's theme, Firelink Shrine's theme and Sif's theme being highlights. 

Combat in this game is weighty where every action you make needs to be deliberate to succeed. Dark Souls difficulty is a bit of a meme, especially in the case of DS1 where the original PC release had the ""Prepare to Die"" subtitle. The game isn't really difficult, it just punishes bad behaviors and not thinking through what you're doing both in exploration and combat. Being too aggressive in combat and not watching your stamina will get you killed in enemy encounters. At the same time spamming dodges without paying attention to enemy patterns will also get you killed. While dodging has generous invincibility enemies will mix up their attack timing, delaying swings and changing patterns. You need to pay attention to both your opponent(s) and your surroundings and adjust each of your actions accordingly. 

For PVE the game is very balanced and offers numerous ways to build and outfit your character. Certain builds will struggle more with certain boss fights and situations but excel at others offering a lot of ways to play and replayability. Between the original release and the remaster I've played 4 very different builds and had a fun and interesting time with each. And despite not being able to re-spec a character on an individual playthrough the game has a ton of replay value with its varied quests, ambitious NG+ features and actually challenging (and farming heavy) achievements. 

While the story is pretty simple, the world's lore and overall tone of the game is incredibly engrossing. At the start of the game, you are given a good baseline of why your character is doing what they're doing and a broad foundation of the world you find yourself. However, by observing your environment for context clues and reading item descriptions you'll find a rich, in-depth lore that lets you have fun filling in the blanks yourself. This is complimented by countless memorable NPC, enemy, environment and weapon designs that still hold up all these years later. 

The remaster is generally an improvement, which with how poor the original PC port was isn't really a great accomplishment. The only major negative is that by changing the lighting system to a more ""realistic"" one the high contrast art style of the original is partially lost making some select areas and enemies look pretty bland compared to the original version of the game. The game still does look good overall however and you wouldn't really notice it unless you were very familiar with the original release. 

As for flaws with the game itself, I feel there are only 2 major ones. The first is that the games netcode is abysmal, PVP in all forms it takes is more funny than something that's really engaging because of how bad the rubberbanding and stuttering can be. Considering this a remastered re-release it’s disappointing nothing was done to address this issue that plagued the original (and all its sequels). Co-op is more forgiving in this regard, however if you are not the host there is still a good chance you can get a bad connection and just end up in a laggy, rubberbanding hell where none of your inputs will be read and acknowledge by the game until 10 seconds after you've pressed them. That being said there is no real reason you need to engage with the online functions of the game outside of trying to get certain covenant rewards. While the idea of invading or protecting other players' games sounds neat in concept the netcode makes it more of a headache in practice. That being said, all of this is entirely optional, you opt-in to the games online function by using an in-game consumable that basically gives you a status effect that enables the online functionality for you. So, by simply not using this item you never have to interact with these parts of the game. The less online intrusive elements like soap-stone messages and player ghosts are still as novel and enjoyable as they were at the time of release, however. 

The second flaw is the covenant system itself. Covenants are in game allegiances that offer certain rewards by ranking them up, normally through collecting certain items and engaging with some form of PVP or co-op. While the concept itself is fine none of these covenants explain how they work or what they reward when you find them in game. While a lot of stuff in Dark Souls is intentionally vague for lore or immersion reasons there is no reason for a player character to blindly join a covenant without being told what their about or what they offer to the player and is immersion breaking in itself. Outside of that this lack of explanation just leaves the player confused and forced to look up information online. This is something that could easily be fixed with in game dialogue from covenant heads or even info in the game menu when interacting with a covenant head. 

Now while I see these as flaws, they are both essentially optional systems (game is fully playable offline and you are never forced to interact with covenants), so they don't hamper the overall experience of the game. If you've not played it before I strongly recommend experiencing it, this is a classic title I grow to appreciate even more as time passes.",True

,148793838,"Started with Elden Ring, going back and playing through all the Souls games minus Demon's Souls/Bloodborne because I don't have a Playstation, surely it'll come to PC soon right? My only frame of reference so far for Soulslikes is Elden Ring so if you don't like me comparing the two then stop reading.

I find it rather interesting that a lot of the DNA in Elden Ring can be found here in the original (sans Demon's Souls) in that there are a lot of diverging paths and exploration is on some level free-form. I was expecting a mostly linear experience but found it was actually pretty open-ended which was really neat, and stumbling randomly across new areas when I was just expecting a dead-end with some item was fantastic. The whole ""if you're stuck somewhere go some place else"" idea is present here as well, although the lack of fast travel until O&S ended up being really annoying for backtracking.

I was expecting to be more annoyed by the massive walks of shame but I got pretty used to them quickly. There are some that are more egregious than others, but the game teaches you to be patient and slow when exploring, so taking time to go back to the boss room wasn't as frustrating (unless I had to go through annoying enemies to get there.) The walks in this game make the run back to Placidusax look like child's play, since while it's pretty long with that fight, you can at least run past a lot of the enemies whereas in this game you often are pretty much forced to fight them unless you want to get stabbed in the back.

PvP is just as bad as Elden Ring, tried it out for a bit, and got teleport backstabbed by a gravekeeper UGS that one-shot me three times in a row before I gave up on trying to guess where he was on his screen due to latency. Speaking of, it's really neat and interesting to me that there are so many different PvP factions that often have unique mechanics. Makes me wonder what it was like in the hayday at peak activity. Kinda rare to get invaded in my playthroughs.

Damage scaling was a nice surprise but it took me one bricked build to realize that vigor is a stat you basically don't have to invest in for half the game. I got stuck on Moonlight on my first playthrough because my ZDPS dex build was failing to 6-round him and it was getting annoying. Read a thread that said you should be 3-rounding him and that re-speccing isn't in the game and got the hint. On my second I basically didn't even level Vigor at all for like half the game.

This game does Dual Bosses right which is a shame since Elden Ring seems to have deeply forgotten this methodology of design. O&S might be one of my favorite bosses now and it's comical to compare it to the foreskin duo in ER. That being said, while boss design in some respects is better, some are just kind of... bad? Capra Demon stands out to me since he's really aggressive and in a tiny room with two dogs that also rush you down, so there's basically nowhere to run and heal. Sure, you can just adapt by playing aggressive and using shield instead of trying to heal off all damage, but I can't help but feel like this fight would be more fun if you had A LITTLE more space between the enemies before they were on you and the arena were maybe... twice as large. with another arena that size placed horizontally? I don't know.

idk how to finish this off, I'll just say Claymore is my baby (love the rolling two-handed R1) and it's insane how they only have one ring slot in the game since one of them is permanently taken up by Ring of Favor and Protection.

,83931356,"Have played through this game 2 times and the OG edition almost to completion a while ago. I quit my first time as I was not enjoying the whole feel of the game at all (I started out with DS2 back in the day and played that and DS3 before 1 which was a big reason for this) as it feels a bit slow and stiff nowadays. But I forced myself through eventually with DS1 R. I did not have alot of fun that time either, and especially in the second half as I did not even enjoy the gameplay, which is basically what carries that part of the game.

But this most recent time I actually had alot of fun which kind of surprised me. I do think it is due to me finally finding a weapon and playstyle that I actually enjoyed with the slower more deliberate gameplay. Earlier I went with dex/quality builds but this time I went full Zweihander and had so much more fun. Also inspired me to do a full playthrough of the series with Zweihander which I am currently very much enjoying.

The game itself is basically split into two parts. Everything up until Anor Londo is basically why this game is regarded as a masterpiece. More so in gameplay and the progression, as I do think the bosses are a bit of a mixed bag, even throughout the whole game in fact with not alot of truly great ones. But dang if the level design is not just incredible, and also the atmosphere. But the second half is actually kind of terrible. Bosses go from pretty good to the absolute worst I have met in a game and the levels are super uninspired in their design. The saving grace in the late game is the DLC which I think have the best bosses in the game by far (Artorias is really fantastic). I do not blame people for not getting through the second half (like myself lol), but I do think it is worth it in the end to get through it all.

Luckily I enjoyed the gameplay way more this time which made that second half much more enjoyable for me. Has very much opened up my eyes more why people still insist the first one is the best, even though it is such a flawed game. I still do not agree as DS3 is still my favorite due to it being great throughout, but at least I now like both DS1 and 2 the same (OG, not SotFS) as they both even out to a similar enjoyment level to me in the end (I liked DS2 way more than 1 back in the day, but I know that can be due to alot of nostalgia) I also think I would rather replay this than DS2 due this game being quite short in comparison. Pretty sweet game and series ofc.

,148352862,"This was my first Souls game. I had a really hard time getting into it. So much so that it took me three rage-uninstalls and four brand-new characters to finally commit to a full playthrough. But boy, when it clicked, it CLICKED. This is, in my opinion, one of the greatest games ever made. 

Pros:
-The level design is probably the greatest ever in gaming history. Every single area is a memorable experience. The game also rewards exploring these unique areas by giving you items, NPCs to talk to, and shortcuts that make your way to the boss easier and faster. 
-The enemy design, of both the common enemies and the bosses, is masterfully done. All of the bosses are unique. They look badass and creepy. 
-The soundtrack is amazing. I sometimes visit Firelink Shrine just to chill and listen to music.
-This is a FromSoft game. So, naturally, the combat is the strongest point of the game. It's rewarding and extremely fun. Getting better after every try against a boss and finally defeating them after hours of trial and error is the most satisfying thing I have ever experienced in any game I have ever played.

Cons:
-Some areas have just a little bit too much bullsh*t. Sometimes it can be helpful to just put the game down, clear your mind, and come back the next day when you feel frustrated about some of that bullsh*t. 
-The game can be too vague at times. [spoiler] Accessing the DLC is an entire quest for no reason at all. I also remember needing to check a guide to find the door that went to the Lower Undead Burg after running around like a mad man trying to find a big door. [/spoiler] But 95% of the time, the game will reward your exploration, and you will eventually find a way to progress.

Amazing game with a great lore. Made me fall in love with the franchise. 
9/10.

,148732126,"Dark souls a game that puts you into tough challenges, tip always spend your souls after you win large chunks of fights or bosses, DO NOT HORDE them, unless your level is higher. It can bite you back if you get to confident.

Also be warned new coming players.
Players with larger hours on the game will invade you with 99 humanity, fully upgraded armor and weapons, at a low level. 

They are called twinks, Run back to the closest bonfire and jump off the cliff, you can block them through the steam player recent play list, to never be invaded by them again, They completely ruin anything PVP wise, you will get one shotted no matter what. You can also deny them by entering boss rooms.

As someone who went from ER to DS3 to DS2 to DS, I was initially worried about not having fast travel*, but I found that the inter-connectivity of the world completely makes up for it. While you have to do a lot more running than other Fromsoft games, it actually becomes enjoyable because you are finding all these cool ways to connect different parts of the world with each other in order to make travel easier. 

When it comes to combat, this game doesn't fall short either. While I personally believe it is worse than ER or DS3 combat, the slower, heavier feel of Dark Souls can be more enjoyable to others. It is also certainly better than DS2 combat.

The worst great videogame I have ever played.

Do you want to to fight your way through poison swamps, treacherous cliffs, and lava lakes, all whilst only being able to dodge in 4 directions. Do you want to get lost, wonder what the hell you are supposed to do to progress, only to figure out you need to spend 20,000 souls, kill a giant wolf, and loot some dead guys grave just to get a ring that lets you fall through a very dark pit? Do you want to fight two bosses at once, or one incredibly frustrating flaming tree? Do you want to fall off of cliff after cliff after cliff, or get stuck in a corner and beat to death. Do you hate dogs? Do you like big booby women? Do you hate yourself? Do you love torture.

,148333125,"It's the Dark Souls that you fell in love with, except you don't have to mod it to not run like garbage. Finally getting to invade and dunk on kids in Sen's Fortress was some of the most fun I've ever had in a video game.",True
,148330046,"As a kid, I had a very dark soul, and the shadows of loneliness enveloped me. My solitary existence was my constant companion, leaving me feeling like an outsider in a world that I perceived as unrelentingly harsh. My solace came from Limp Bizkit's music, whose angsty tunes resonated deeply with my troubled soul. Fred Durst's raw and emotional lyrics were the soundtrack to my life, speaking to the darkness that consumed me.

But then, I discovered Dark Souls Remastered on Steam, a game that would alter the course of my journey. Just like Limp Bizkit's intense music, the game plunged me into a world of shadows, challenging me at every turn. It felt like I was confronting the abyss within me, just as Limp Bizkit's lyrics had done for years.

The brutal difficulty and relentless enemies in Dark Souls Remastered taught me lessons that Limp Bizkit's music couldn't. It was a reflection of my own life – failures, setbacks, and relentless struggles. And much like Limp Bizkit's music, the game showed me that even in the darkest moments, there are glimpses of light.

The game's intricate level design and hauntingly beautiful landscapes hinted at the hope that I'd never allowed myself to see before. It was as if Fred Durst's lyrics had come to life in the game, reminding me that even the darkest souls have pockets of brightness.

Just like Limp Bizkit's music served as my therapy, Dark Souls Remastered became my escape and a source of inspiration. It helped me confront the abyss within my soul and provided the strength to overcome it. I realized that, much like Limp Bizkit's music, there's redemption even in the darkest corners of life.

As I write this review, I can't help but draw parallels between my life, Limp Bizkit's music, and Dark Souls Remastered. They've all been essential in guiding me from darkness to light, proving that even the darkest souls can be remastered and can have spaces where it's bright and light sometimes.

TLDR: Limp Bizkit's music, like Dark Souls Remastered, shines a light on the darkest corners of the soul. Both have shown me that even the darkest souls can find redemption, just like Limp Bizkit's lyrics resonate in the darkest moments of life.",True

,140946711,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect during my first playthrough of DS1 as I had only played Elden Ring. I have to say the game still holds up very well to my surprise and it is still great for first time enjoyers. The bosses are amazing and to my surprise I still remember the name of almost all of the bosses which I typically can't which just shows how memorable each boss is. The gameplay is still amazing which I honestly wasn't expecting considering it was the first in the series (I know demon souls came out before dark souls but I'm referring to the dark souls series) I can't wait to get all the achievements for DS1 and playthrough DSII and DSIII. If you haven't tried this game before or are on the fence about it I highly recommend you give it a try.

,148228373,"So the hours posted here are wrong. I've been playing this game way longer, but I originally was on Xbox. I actually have around 900 hours in this game, but regardless I'm not here to brag about playtime. I'm here to review one of my favorite games of all time, while also shitting on how this is a horrible remaster. This game, as a lot of people know, is absolutely amazing. From its interconnected world, to its methodical and intricate combat, this game is a joy. I don't want to go way too in depth over the game itself, as this is the REMASTERED version, not the original. All you really need to know is if you're considering Dark Souls, then buy it and give it a shot. Worst case scenario you can refund it if it's not for you! If this is up your alley, however, then prepare yourself for a magical experience until you kill O&S and it goes down to being just a pretty good experience (then it becomes a masterpiece then with Artorias of the Abyss). One other thing, though, this is a wiki game. Just like games like Terraria and Barotrauma, this game wants you to look at the wiki and learn about it, as it's super convoluted. Don't feel ashamed for checking out the wiki!
Anyways, onto the remastered part: it sucks. I wasn't lucky enough to get PtDE before it got delisted, but looking at comparisons they are next to the same thing given you install a performance mod for PtDE that is widely available and easy to use. If you own PtDE, this game is just as dead so don't bother getting it for the multiplayer. This was how I got started as a sunbro, but it's dead now just like the original. As with the Vampire Survivors review, I won't be putting a number score here because number scores are BS in my opinion, but my overall verdict is that it's still Dark Souls I, but if you already own another version of DS1 then don't bother.",True

,148197428,"Hard at first. But with each boss you kill, each enemy you slaughter, and with each time you yourself are ended. you will begin to learn the tells of a swing and the spacing of your sword. you will scrape at bosses until you grovel out a victory, you will make death runs until you can do it with your eyes closed, you will kill the same enemies over and over again. But for what you ask? It certainly is not fun to die and run back just to do it again. Well my friend, its when you first learn to parry the black knights, when you finally kill that one boss, when you find the coolest looking Armour, when you forge a great weapon out of souls and sweat, when after you have fought tooth and nail you come out on top. This game is great because its hard and unforgiving, This game is great because even though it was hard and unforgiving you didn't give up. Its great because it challenges you and respects the efforts you put into it. --- In short, I recommend this game to any who have not dared to play something so challenging, because it will show you what you can do if you really try. ---",True

,148162459,"What if you built an entire game around the respawn? What if THE RESPAWN were a game mechanic? I don’t know if this game is for me. I’m trying, but I feel as if the game punishes me for exploration. Combat is so rigid and tanklike, but not impossible. Still, every enemy does enormous damage and takes so many hit points to defeat. Took me a few tries to beat the first boss, but I did it. Everything after that has been so awkward. I meet skeletons, but fighting them is not worth it. What I’m reading about the game says it’s damn near impossible to conquer it without taking tips from the community, which tells me to avoid combat as much as possible and collect items instead. But what are these items? Why am I collecting them?

Why are minor enemies such a MAJOR EVENT to fight? Challenge stems from the clunky combat controls instead of anything deliberate. When I die, often it’s because the game didn’t respond when I wanted to roll, or didn’t block when I pushed the button. So far I’m not enjoying this, all of these stats and items. Why can’t I assign a throwing item to a quick slot for easy use? I can’t explore without facing enemies I can’t defeat. I can’t fight. I can’t outrun most of the enemies. What am I doing?

The whole game seems to be built around the idea of respawning: the game will kill you over and over, but that’s ok because you can just go back and figure out how to proceed from there. [b]When I progress, I don’t feel as if I’m getting better at the game’s internal logic, rather that I’m bypassing the game.[/b] What is the point of combat if you’re not supposed to fight most of the enemies?

,148104093,"An undeniable amazing game of it's time, and still an unforgettable game 13 years later. Although the game severely falls flat in the egregiously unfinished second half of the game (Not including DLC). The bosses are rushed, the enemies are boring, and the level design is either unnecessarily frustrating or just plain out ridiculous. Don't let that take away from the experience of the game as a whole, the entirety of the first half of the game is near perfect, the soundtrack throughout stays consistently top of the line, and a memorable art/designs direction.

It's important to also take into account that this game is supposed to be a 'remaster', which is an absolute disgrace and money scam. It's a port with a a remaster on the price tag. 

Aside from the what i previously stated about the latter half of the game, the rest of the game is the exact opposite. An ingeniously connected overarching map, extremely hard but CONSISTENTLY fair enemies and bosses, innovative combat and movement, and an unforgettable experience.

As a essentially the father to the souls series, it's impossible to not notice the influence this game has had on the gaming industry as a whole. If the team had more budget to finish the second half of the game, this game would be a goddamn masterpiece. I would highly recommend a try.
